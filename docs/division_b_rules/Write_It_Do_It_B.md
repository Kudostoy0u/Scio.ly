# Write It Do It B

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

1. DESCRIPTION: One participant will write a description of an object and how to build it. The other participant will attempt to construct the object from this description.
A TEAM OF: 2			
APPROXIMATE TIME: 50 minutes
2. EVENT PARAMETERS:
a. The participant who will be doing the writing must bring a writing utensil.
b. No other materials or resources are allowed.
3. THE COMPETITION:
a. One participant from each team is shown an object, which may be abstract but is the same for all teams, built from, but not limited to, such items as science materials, inexpensive materials (e.g., straws, push pins, Styrofoam balls, paper cups, Popsicle sticks, etc.) or commercial sets (e.g., K’nex, Tinker Toys, Lego, Lincoln Logs, etc.). This participant is not allowed to touch the object unless the Event Supervisor permits it.
b. The participant viewing the object has twenty-five (25) minutes to write a description of the object and how to build it. There will be no advantage to finishing early.
c. Drawings and diagrams of the model or subsections of the model are not allowed. Numerals, words and single letters that fit within the context of the written description are allowed. The participant may use abbreviations and do not have to define the abbreviation. Editing, punctuation, or scientific symbols that fit within the context of the written description are allowed.
d. The Event Supervisor will pass the description to the second team member who will take the description and attempt to recreate (build) the original object in twenty (20) minutes.
e. Supervisors will attempt to use different materials than the materials that were used last year.
4. SCORING:
a. The team that builds the object nearest to the original and has a written description with no drawings or diagrams will be declared the winner.
b. Each individual piece will receive points as applicable for: proper size, color, location, orientation, and/ or connection.
c. Pieces that are connected correctly beyond an incorrect connection will be counted in the score. No penalty will be assessed for parts that were not used.
d. Students drawing a subsection of the model will be ranked in Tier 2. Drawing a picture of the model will result in disqualification.
e. Time for the construction phase will be used as a tiebreaker.
