# Water Quality B

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

1. DESCRIPTION: Participants will be assessed on their understanding and evaluation of freshwater aquatic environments.
A TEAM OF UP TO: 2			 APPROXIMATE TIME: 50 minutes
EYE PROTECTION: C 			 CALCULATOR: Class II
2. EVENT PARAMETERS:
a. Each team may bring writing utensils.
b. Each team may bring two Class II calculators.
c. Each team may bring one (1) 8.5” x 11” sheet of paper that may contain information on both sides in any form and from any source. The sheet of paper may be laminated or placed in a sheet protector to increase durability. Affixed labels, as well as multiple sheets of paper (whether in a single sheet protector or not) are prohibited.
d. Each team may bring one student built salinometer/hydrometer for testing.
e. Participants must wear eye protection during Salinometer Testing (3.Part IV). Teams without proper eye protection must be immediately informed and given a chance to obtain eye protection if time allows.
3. THE COMPETITION: This may include analysis, interpretation or use of charts, graphs and sample data. Supervisors are expected to utilize freshwater scenarios and have students analyze and evaluate comparative macroinvertebrates and water quality data. Process skills may include equipment use, collecting and interpreting data, measuring, analyzing data, and making inferences.
Part I: Freshwater Ecology – 30% of the total score
a. This section will use multiple choice, matching, fill-in-the-blank and/or short answer questions in areas such as: aquatic ecology, water cycle, nutrient cycling, aquatic chemistry and its implications for life, potable water treatment, waste water treatment, aquatic food chains/webs, community interactions, population dynamics, watershed resource management issues, sedimentation pollution, and harmful species.
Part II: Freshwater Macroinvertebrates – 30% of the total score
a. This section will require participants to identify (common name only) immature and adult macroinvertebrates and aquatic nuisance organisms listed below.
b. In addition, teams should understand their importance as indicators of water and wetland quality.

Part III: Water Monitoring and Analysis – 30% of the total score
a. Participants should be able to understand and interpret data related to testing procedures and purposes for collecting data related to salinity, pH, phosphates, turbidity dissolved oxygen, temperature, nitrates, fecal coliform, total solids, biochemical oxygen demand and their relationship to one another.
b. No physical laboratory tests will be performed on these topics by participants.
Part IV: Salinometer Testing – 10% of the total score
a. Teams must build, calibrate, bring and demonstrate a salinometer/hydrometer capable of measuring saltwater (most likely NaCl) concentrations between 1-10% (mass/volume). Students may build a simple electronic salinometer if they wish. No programmable devices or those that can communicate over wifi are allowed. No laptops, tablets, or other similar devices may be used in the competition.
b. There are no restrictions on size except that the team must build the device to operate within a standard 400 – 600 mL beaker filled with at least 400 mL of the saltwater solution.
c. Teams will be expected to estimate the percent salinity measured by their device to the nearest tenth of a percent. Full credit will be given ±1% at Regionals and ±0.5% at State/Nationals. Calibration solutions may or may not be provided by the Event Supervisor.
4. SCORING:
a. High score wins.
i. Points will be assigned to the various questions and problems for Parts I, II and III.
ii. Points for bringing a salinometer for testing will be 5% of the total score.
iii. Points for making an accurate salinity measurement per 3.PartIV.c will be 5% of the total score.
b. Selected questions may be used as tiebreakers.
