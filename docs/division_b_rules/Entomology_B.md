# Entomology B

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

1. DESCRIPTION: Students will be asked to identify insects and selected immature insects by indicated taxonomy (order, subclass, or family), answer questions about insects, and use or construct a dichotomous key. All specimens will be representatives of insects found in the Contiguous United States.
A TEAM OF UP TO: 2			 APPROXIMATE TIME: 50 minutes
2. EVENT PARAMETERS:
a. Each team may bring one 2” or smaller three-ring binder, as measured by the interior diameter of the rings, containing information in any form and from any source. Sheet protectors, lamination, tabs, and labels are permitted. If the event features a rotation through a series of laboratory stations where the participants interact with samples, specimens, or displays, no material may be removed from the binder throughout the event.
b. Each team may also have one commercially produced field guide which may be tabbed or annotated.
c. In addition to their resource binder and field guide, each team may bring one (1) copy of either the 2026 National Entomology List or a State or Regional Entomology List if issued.
d. Each team may bring one hand lens or magnifying glass. The Supervisor will provide dissecting microscopes, if needed.
3. THE COMPETITION:
a. Teams will be asked to identify an insect's Order, Subclass, Family or common name and answer a related question(s). Questions are limited to topics below and insects are limited to those listed on the 2026 National Entomology List, which is based on the Insects of North America Princeton Field Guide (2023).
b. Insect specimens or images (nymph or larva for selected orders and families) will be exhibited so that students will be able to see pertinent features with the unaided eye or a hand lens. Students may be asked to use or formulate a simple dichotomous key to identify insects.
c. For each specimen, students will be asked correlated questions that pertain to the insect’s internal and external anatomy, ecology, economic characteristics, or systematics.
d. Ecological characteristics may include habitats, adaptations to the environment, behavior, relationships (e.g. symbiosis and competition) with animals, plants, and public health, as well as climate change impacts.
e. Economic characteristics may include beneficial or detrimental aspects of insects such as sources of food, medicine, disease, chemicals, nutrients, and insects as nuisance species.
f. State and Nationals Only: For specimens, students may be asked questions that pertain to management. Such questions may pertain to pest/disease/invasive species concerns, Integrated Pest Management (IPM), conservation, and urban entomology. (IPM refers to preventing or suppressing damaging populations of insect pests by application of comprehensive and coordinated integration of multiple control tactics: chemical, biological, and cultural controls in context of their economic, environmental, and social consequences.)
4. SCORING:
a. The high score wins.
b. Preselected questions will be used as tiebreakers.
Recommended Resources: The Science Olympiad Store (store.soinc.org) carries a variety of resources to purchase; other resources are available on the Event Pages at soinc.org.
