# Metric Mastery B

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

1. DESCRIPTION: Teams will estimate and then measure properties of identical objects including mass, area, volume, density, force, distance, time, and temperature. Teams will also perform metric unit conversions.
A TEAM OF UP TO: 2 			 APPROXIMATE TIME: 50 minutes
			
CALCULATOR: Class II
2. EVENT PARAMETERS:
a. The event will be divided into 3 sections. Sections One & Three combined will involve estimating and measuring properties of objects at stations.
b. Participants will rotate through stations to make their estimations in Section One - Estimation, and then in Section Three - Measurement, they will use measuring devices to measure the same or identical objects at the stations. Some of the stations will ask for calculated measurements - measurements that require formula calculations (e.g., calculating the density of an object, surface area, velocity, etc). The number of calculated measurements will be based on the level of competition per the following:
i. No more than 20% of the stations at the Regional level.
ii. At least 20% but not more than 40% of the stations at the State level.
iii. At least 40% but not more than 60% of the stations at the National level.
c. Measuring devices must be kept out of sight during Section One - Estimation.
d. The property to be estimated or measured and the units of measurement must be identified in the directions at each station. Prior to the competition supervisors must determine the acceptable measurement value with the same equipment that is to be used at each station.
e. Participants must not bring watches, writing implements, electronic devices (with the exception of a calculator for Section Three), notes, or use any kind of measuring device (e.g., fingers, pieces of paper, pencils, clothing, etc.). Each team may bring two Class II calculators for use during Section Three.
f. Supervisors must furnish writing implements, paper, and all measuring devices needed for the event.
g. All measurement and calculation units must be limited to the metric (SI) system.
3. THE COMPETITION: For each part participants will be given an answer sheet to record their answers. Each answer sheet must be turned in prior to the next section or the team will lose their score for that section.
a. Section One - Estimation:
i. Time Limit Expectations
(1) Regional Tournaments will be a minimum of 60 seconds per station
(2) State Tournaments will be a minimum of 45 seconds per station
(3) National Tournaments will be a minimum of 30 seconds per station
ii. Participants must not touch or feel any of the objects, unless the station directions specifically state the object may be touched. Participants must be allowed to “heft” an object for estimated masses.
b. Section Two - Metric Unit Conversion:
i. This part must be after the completion of Section One and before beginning Section Three.
ii. Participants will have 5 minutes to complete 5 Metric Unit Conversion problems.
iii. Participants will be asked to convert 5 metric numbers to a specific different metric unit and must not be required to convert from one measurement system to another (e.g., metric to standard).
iv. At the regional tournament level event supervisors will provide students with a metric prefix chart including all needed prefixes for the given exam.
c. Section Three - Measurement:
i. Time Limit Expectations
(1) Regional Tournaments will be a minimum of 90 seconds per station
(2) State Tournaments will be a minimum of 75 seconds per station
(3) National Tournaments will be a minimum of 60 seconds per station
ii. Measurements must be made using the supervisor-supplied instruments, expressed to the instrument’s resolution (the smallest division/markings/graduations on its scale) plus one estimated digit (if appropriate/analog). An estimated digit must not be provided for a digital measurement.
iii. To receive points, measurements must be expressed using the proper resolution and estimated digit appropriate for the instrument(s) provided, and the proper unit of measurement. Example: Correct answer = 9.0 cm. If the answer given by the team is 9 cm or 9.0, the answer will be marked wrong.
4. SCORING:
a. High score wins. Final Score = Estimation Score + Metric Unit Conversion Score + Measurement Score.
b. Section One - Estimation:
i. Scoring Expectations - To receive the number of points in the column, estimations must be within the following range:

c. Section Two - Metric Unit Conversions: Answers must be with the correct unit written to receive 5 points. All other answers receive zero points. Example: Convert 14.56 mm to hm. Correct answer = 0.0001456 hm.
d. Part Three - Measurements:
i. Direct Measurements: Measurements (not involving calculations) will be scored according to the following table for analog measurements. Digital measurements will be scored at all levels as 5 points for +/- one final digit, 3 points for +/- two final digits, and one point for +/- three final digits.

Example: At a regional tournament the Supervisor measured the width of a page as 209.1 mm using a ruler whose smallest divisions are 1.0 mm.
● Five points would be awarded for a measurement between 207.6 mm and 210.6 mm
● Three points for a measurement between 206.1 mm and 212.1 mm
● One point for a measurement between 204.6 mm and 213.6 mm.
● No points would be awarded for a measurement outside of 204.6 mm and 213.6 mm.
ii. Calculated Measurements: Measurements that require formula calculations will be scored using the same direct measurement scoring ranges provided above.
iii. Calculated measurements are limited to area and volume of polygons/polyhedrons, density of contained liquids, solids, and powders, melting and boiling points of water, force, mechanical energy, displacement of liquid by a solid, time constants/periods of simple harmonic motion, mass of solids and liquids, and spring constants.
Example: At a state tournament, the Supervisor measured and calculated for an area: 13.45 cm x 22.32 cm = 300.2 cm2.
● For five points: within -0.12: 13.33 cm x 22.20 cm = 295.9 cm2, within +0.12: 13.57 cm x 22.44 cm = 304.5 cm2.
● For three points: within -0.20: 13.25 cm x 22.12 cm = 293.0 cm2, within +0.20: 13.65 cm x 22.52 cm = 307.4 cm2.
● For one point: within -0.30: 13.15 cm x 22.02 cm = 289.6 cm2, within +0.30: 13.75 cm x 22.62 cm = 311.0 cm2.
● Measurements outside the range of 289.6 cm2 to 311.0 cm2 will receive zero points.
e. Penalties: Penalties, up to 10%, may be applied to teams who do not return measuring devices to their original locations, do not clean up spills, and/or intentionally alter or damage equipment or objects.
f. Ties will be broken using tiebreaker stations designated prior to the start of the event.
