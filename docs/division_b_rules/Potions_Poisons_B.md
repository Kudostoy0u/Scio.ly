# Potions & Poisons B

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

1. DESCRIPTION: This event is about chemical properties and effects of specified toxic and therapeutic chemical substances, with a focus on household and environmental toxins or poisons.
A TEAM OF UP TO: 2			 APPROXIMATE TIME: 50 minutes
EYE PROTECTION: C 			 CALCULATOR: Class II
2. EVENT PARAMETERS:
a. Each participant may bring one 8.5” x 11” sheet of paper, which may be in a sheet protector sealed by tape or laminated, that may contain information on both sides in any form and from any source without any affixed labels.
b. Each participant must bring a writing implement and may bring a Class II calculator.
c. Teams should bring any or all of the items listed on the Division B Chemistry Events Lab Equipment List, posted on soinc.org. Teams not bringing these items will be at a disadvantage, as they are not provided.
d. Participants must wear goggles, an apron or a lab coat and have skin covered from the neck down to the wrist and toes. Gloves are optional, but if the host requires a specific type they will notify teams. Pants should be loose fitting; if the host has more specific guidelines, they will notify teams in advance of the tournament. Shoulder length or longer hair must be tied back. Participants removing safety clothing/ goggles or unsafely handling materials, or equipment will be penalized or disqualified.
e. Supervisors will provide any required reagents, additional glassware, and/or references that are needed for the tasks (e.g., Periodic Table, etc.)
3. THE COMPETITION: The competition will be conducted in two parts.
a. Part 1--Exam: This part will be a multiple-choice and short answer test covering the following subject areas: Students should understand ionic and covalent bonds, and the difference between mixtures, solutions and compounds. Students may be asked to separate components of a mixture. Students will distinguish between physical and chemical changes. Students may be asked to balance a simple chemical equation. Students may be asked to identify various poisonous plants and animals, and their toxic effects. Students may be given a map and be asked to analyze the potential patterns of spread of toxic spills in the environment via water, wind or gravity. Students will understand the effects and chemistry of common household toxins. Students should understand the effect of dilution on toxicity.
The test may include information on the following specific toxins:
i. Household chemicals: ammonia, hydrogen peroxide, rubbing alcohol, bleach, Epsom salts, vinegar, nutritional supplements containing calcium and iron.
ii. Toxic living organisms: poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans), giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum), Calabar bean (Physostigma venenosum), rhubarb (Rheum rhaponticum), American false hellebore (Veratrum viride), cane toad (Rhinella marina), poison dart frog (Dendrobatidae), Portuguese man o’ war (Physalia physalis), lionfish (Pterois sp), fat tail scorpion (Androctonus australis)
iii. Environmental toxins: copper, lead, and mercury.
b. Part 2--Lab: Students will be asked to perform at least one lab task themselves. Other lab exercises may be performed as a demonstration, at the discretion of the event supervisor. Lab activities will be drawn from: chromatography, mixtures of reagents, separation of a mixture, serial dilutions, determination of pH, and conductivity testing. Reagents may be mixed by students or the event supervisor with subsequent observation of changes in temperature or color, production of a gas or a precipitate, the relative rate of a chemical reaction or other parameters. Students may be asked if a particular change is a physical or chemical change.
4. SCORING: High Score wins. Part 1: Test questions are worth 60% of the competition. Part 2: Lab questions are worth 40% of the score. Selected questions or quality of free response answers will be used to break ties.

Recommended Resources: The Science Olympiad Store (store.soinc.org) carries a variety of resources to purchase; other resources are available on the Event Pages at soinc.org.
