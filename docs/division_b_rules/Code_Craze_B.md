# Code Craze B

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

1. DESCRIPTION: Teams will demonstrate their ability to write, debug and execute computer programs in a console environment in support of the competition theme.
A TEAM OF UP TO: 2
APPROXIMATE TIME: 50 minutes
CALCULATOR: Class III
2. EVENT PARAMETERS:
a. Each team may bring two Class III calculators. No other notes, resources, or electronic devices are permitted.
b. The Event Supervisor will provide computers with a functional IDE (e.g., VS Code, Eclipse, or similar), a compiler/interpreter for Python 3.x, and access to a basic text editor.
c. The competition will be conducted in a console environment. No graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or external libraries are permitted unless specified by the Event Supervisor.
d. Participants must be able to answer questions regarding their code, algorithms, and problem-solving strategies.
3. THE COMPETITION:
a. Teams will be given a competition theme (e.g., environmental science, space exploration, historical events) and a set of programming problems related to that theme. The problems will require teams to write code to solve computational tasks, analyze data, or simulate processes.
b. The problems will cover fundamental programming concepts, including but not limited to:
i. Variables and data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, dictionaries).
ii. Control flow (if-else statements, for loops, while loops).
iii. Functions and modular programming.
iv. Basic input/output operations.
v. String manipulation and basic data processing.
vi. Simple algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, mathematical calculations).
c. Teams will be provided with specific input formats and expected output formats for each problem. Programs must adhere strictly to these specifications for correct scoring.
d. Partial credit may be awarded for programs that demonstrate correct logic but have minor errors (e.g., syntax errors, off-by-one errors) or for partially solved problems.
e. Teams will be judged on the correctness, efficiency, and clarity of their code. Solutions that are elegant and well-commented will receive higher scores.
f. The Event Supervisor may ask teams to explain their code or problem-solving approach during or after the competition.
4. SCORING:
a. High score wins. Points will be awarded for successfully solving each programming problem.
b. The Event Supervisor will determine the point values for each problem based on its complexity and difficulty.
c. Tiebreakers will be determined by:
i. The time taken to complete all problems (faster time wins).
ii. The number of problems solved correctly.
iii. The quality and efficiency of the code (at the discretion of the Event Supervisor).
Recommended Resources: The Science Olympiad Store (store.soinc.org) carries a variety of resources to purchase; other resources are available on the Event Pages at soinc.org.
