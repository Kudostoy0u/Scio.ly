# Eye Protection Guide B

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

The Eye Protection Guide outlines the requirements for eye protection in various Science Olympiad events. This is critical for participant safety during hands-on activities and experiments. While the specific details are not provided in the text, it typically categorizes eye protection levels (e.g., B or C) and specifies which level is required for different events.

**Note:** This section is a placeholder. Please refer to the official Science Olympiad website (soinc.org) for the most current and accurate Eye Protection Guide.
