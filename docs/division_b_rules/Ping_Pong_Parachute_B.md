# Ping Pong Parachute B

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

1. DESCRIPTION: Teams will design, construct, and test a device that launches a ping pong ball attached to a parachute, aiming for maximum hang time. The device will be impounded.
A TEAM OF UP TO: 2
APPROXIMATE TIME: 10 minutes
IMPOUND: Yes
EYE PROTECTION: B
2. EVENT PARAMETERS:
a. Only one device designed and built by the team may be entered, built prior to competition.
b. Eye Protection B protective eyewear must be worn during competition (required ANSI marking: Z87+).
c. Design Knowledge: Participants must be able to answer questions on design, construction & operation.
d. The Event Supervisor will provide the ping pong ball and measure height and time.
e. No outside tools, materials, or communications are permitted during the competition time.
3. CONSTRUCTION PARAMETERS:
a. The device, in its launch configuration, must fit entirely within a 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm cube. No part of the device may extend beyond these dimensions at any point during impound or competition setup.
b. The parachute must be made of a single sheet of material (e.g., plastic bag, tissue paper, fabric) and have an unladen mass of no more than 5 grams. It must be attached to a standard ping pong ball (provided by the Event Supervisor) using string or tape. The ping pong ball must be easily detachable for inspection.
c. The launch mechanism must be entirely mechanical. No propellants, explosives, compressed gases, or electrical components are permitted. Stored energy (e.g., springs, rubber bands) is allowed, provided it is part of the mechanical launch system and contained within the device dimensions.
d. The device must be designed to launch the ping pong ball and parachute vertically. Horizontal projection is not permitted and will result in disqualification.
4. THE COMPETITION:
a. Impound: Teams must impound their device with the Event Supervisor at the designated time. The ping pong ball and parachute should be presented separately for inspection.
b. Check-in: i. Once participants begin check-in, they may NOT leave or gain any outside assistance, materials, or communications (including cell phone communication) until testing is completed. ii. No alterations may be made once check-in begins. iii. Event Supervisor or Assistant will begin check-in: (1) Verify participants have proper Eye Protection (2.b.). (2) Inspect device design and construction materials (3.a., 3.b., 3.c.). (3) Participants demonstrate the detachability of the ping pong ball and parachute for inspection. (4) The Event Supervisor will attach the ping pong ball to the parachute, and the parachute to the device.
c. Launch: i. Teams will have 5 minutes to set up their device and perform one official launch. ii. The launch begins when the participant initiates the mechanical launch mechanism. iii. Time aloft starts when the ping pong ball and parachute leave the device and ends when any part of the ping pong ball or parachute touches the ground or any obstruction. iv. Event Supervisors are strongly encouraged to utilize three (3) timers on all flights. The median flight time in seconds to the precision of the device used is the official Time aloft.
v. The launch height will be measured from the point where the ping pong ball leaves the device to its highest point.
5. SCORING:
a. High score wins. Score = Time Aloft (seconds) + Height Bonus.
b. Height Bonus: 1 point will be awarded for every full meter of height achieved by the ping pong ball, rounded down (e.g., 2.5 meters = 2 points).
c. Penalties: i. Devices exceeding dimensional limits (3.a.) will incur a 20% penalty on the final score. ii. Any device failing to launch vertically (3.d.) will be disqualified. iii. Failure to wear eye protection will result in disqualification.
d. Tiebreakers: i. Longest flight time. ii. Greatest launch height.
