# Solar System B

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

1. DESCRIPTION: Participants will demonstrate their knowledge of planet formation and structure within and beyond the Solar System.
A TEAM OF UP TO: 2			
APPROXIMATE TIME: 50 minutes
2. EVENT PARAMETERS:
a. Each team may bring two 8.5” x 11” sheets of paper, which may be in a sheet protector sealed by tape or laminated, that may contain information on both sides in any form and from any source without any affixed labels. Calculators are not allowed.
3. THE COMPETITION: Participants will be tested over the content described below. We encourage exams to emphasize mathematical reasoning, conceptual understanding, and interpretation of data from maps, graphs, images, photographs, charts, and/or tables whenever possible (i.e., minimize trivia).
a. Participants will be asked to identify and explain surface, atmospheric, and spectroscopic features and processes (e.g., cratering, storms, etc.) associated with the following objects/systems. They will also answer questions about these objects/systems’ properties and connections to the content areas defined in 3.b. Most questions about specific objects/systems should focus on objects in the Solar System (3.a.i.) rather than extrasolar systems (3.a.ii.). Furthermore, exams should not contain detailed questions about objects/systems that are not listed in 3.a.i. or 3.a.ii.
i. Objects in the Solar System: Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, Ceres, Earth’s Moon, Triton, 25143 Itokawa, Tempel 1, and 486958 Arrokoth
ii. Extrasolar Systems: HL Tauri, 51 Pegasi, HD 209458, and Beta Pictoris
b. Participants may also be tested on the following topics:
i. Planet formation (e.g., core accretion, disk instability, minimum mass solar nebula, etc.) and evolution (e.g., migration, mass loss, etc.) within and beyond the Solar System.
ii. Comparing internal/atmospheric structure, composition, etc. across planet types within and beyond the Solar System (e.g., Mercury vs. Neptune, Uranus vs. Saturn, Jupiter vs. hot Jupiters, etc.).
iii. Properties (e.g., composition, location, etc.) of small Solar System bodies (e.g., asteroids, comets, etc.) as they relate to planet formation/structure or the early history of the Solar System.
iv. Exoplanet detection techniques, limited to transits, radial velocity, and direct imaging.
v. General engineering principles and science objectives underlying the design of spacecraft and telescopes. Participants may be asked specific questions about only the following: BepiColombo, Galileo, Juno, Cassini, Voyager 2, New Horizons, Dawn, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, Hayabusa, Deep Impact, ALMA, Hubble, and JWST.
vi. Mathematical concepts relevant to planet formation and structure, including, but not limited to: density, light/radiation (e.g., Stefan-Boltzmann law, Wien’s displacement law, Doppler shift), and gravity/orbits (e.g., energy, force, momentum, Newton’s law of gravitation, Kepler’s Laws). Questions must not require a calculator and should emphasize algebraic manipulation (e.g., rearranging/deriving equations), order of magnitude estimation, and proportions.
4. SCORING:
a. Points will be awarded for the quality and accuracy of responses. High score wins.
b. Preselected questions/sections will be used as tiebreakers.
Recommended Resources: The Science Olympiad Store (store.soinc.org) carries a variety of resources to purchase; other resources are available on the Event Pages at soinc.org.
This event is supported by NASA's Universe of Learning Astrophysics STEM Learning and Literacy Network
