(12) Run Time and Vehicle Distance will be measured and recorded for Successful runs.
(13) Any violations will be recorded. See Run Penalties under Scoring. The ES must notify the participants of any violations at the end of each run.
(14) Track Time will resume once the participants pick up their device or begin working. Unless their Track Time has ended.
(15) The Event Supervisor will review with teams their data recorded.
(16) Teams filing an appeal must leave their Robot and other impounded material in the event area.

5. SCORING:
a. Low score wins. Each team’s Final Score is their lowest Run Score plus any Final Score Penalties.
b. The Run Score for each run
i. Successful Run = 200 + Time Score + Distance Score + Bonuses + Run Penalties
ii. Failed Run = 1000 points + Run Penalties
c. The Time Score is determined by:
i. Run Time less than Target Time:			Time Score = (Target Time - Run Time) x 2
ii. Run Time greater or equal to Target Time:
Time Score = (Run Time - Target Time)
d. Distance Score = 2.0 pt/cm x Robot Distance.
e. Gate Bonus = -15 points for each Gate Zone entered in any order. Gates are only counted once per run.
f. Water Bottle Bonus = -15 points for each Water Bottle moved into a Gate Zone.
i. The Water Bottle must be completely within the Gate Zone border and upright.
ii. If multiple Water Bottles are within the same Gate Zone, only one Water Bottle will be counted.
iii. The bonus is awarded at the end of the run and not when a Bottle is moved into a Gate Zone.
g. Track Time Bonus (National Only) = (Track Time Used - 550) / 30 points
i. Tournament Directors may choose to add this bonus with advance notice.
h. Run Penalties:
i. Contact Penalty: 70 points added to each Run Score where Robot or Bottle makes 1 or more contacts with the 2x4 Obstacles.
ii. No 2x4 Obstacle Penalty: 50 points added to all Run Scores when a team chooses to run with the 2x4 Obstacles.
iii. Stalling Penalty: 20 points added to each Run Score with a Stalling Action.
iv. Competition Violation: 150 points added to the Run Score that has 1 or more Competition Violations.
v. Construction Violation: 300 points added to the Run Score that has 1 or more Construction Violations.
vi. Failed Runs can also be assessed Competition and/or Construction violations.
i. Bonuses and penalties are awarded independent of each other. For example, a run score can have both the Gate Zone Bonus and the 2x4 Obstacle Penalty.
j. Final Score Penalties:
i. Robot’s movements tested during Setup Time: 200 points added to the team’s Final Score.
ii. Robot or Program Not Impounded: 1500 points added to the team’s Final Score.

6. SCORING EXAMPLES:
a. At a competition, the track has 4 Gates (A, B, C & D). Target Time is 73 seconds. A team’s Robot stopped 21.7 cm from the Target Point with a Run Time of 62.53 sec. Gate Zones were entered in the following order “C”, “D”, and “A”. Two (2) Water Bottles were moved into Gate Zones. The team had a recorded Track Time of 7 minutes and 35 seconds.
Base Score
= 200
=
200.00
Time Score
= (73 - 62.53) x 2
=
20.94
Distance Score
= 21.7cm x 2.0 pts/cm
=
43.40
Gate Bonus
= 3 Gates x -15 pts/Gate
=
-45.00
Water Bottle Bonus = 2 Bottles x -15 pts/Bottle
=
-30.00
Run Score
=
189.34

7. THE TRACK:
a. In-Person tournaments: The ES will supply and set up the Track.
b. Virtual tournaments: Team will supply the Track that fully complies with the requirements of this section. Any deviation will be scored as a competition violation for all runs.
c. Track Definition:
i. The track area will be a 2 meter by 2.5 meter square area on a smooth, level, and hard surface.
ii. The Outer Boundary Lines of the Track will be defined using the inside edge 2.5 cm wide tape.
iii. The outside tape lines will be marked every 0.5 m or 50 cm for the imaginary lines within the track area. There are three (3) imaginary lines in the vertical direction and four (4) imaginary lines in the horizontal directions for a total of seven (7) lines. All imaginary lines are perpendicular to the outside tape lines. The imaginary lines will form twenty (20) square zones (approximately 50 cm x 50 cm) within the track area. It is recommended to use ¼” wide tape to mark all imaginary lines, but not required.
iv. The Start Point will be marked on the inside edge of the outer boundary tape line. The Start Point will be centered between any imaginary line and/or a perpendicular outer boundary tape line.
v. The Target Point will be in the center of one of the twenty (20) zones defined by the imaginary lines and outer tape lines. The Target Point will be marked on approximately 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm tape with the Target Point marked at the center of the tape.
vi. Up to ten (10) wooden 2x4 Obstacles are placed on the tracklines. The 2x4 can be placed on any imaginary line or outside tape lines. The 2x4s are placed approximately centered between adjacent perpendicular track lines (outside or imaginary). The dimensions of the 2x4 obstacles are approximately 1.5 inches by 3.5 inches by 16 inches long.
vii. Bonus Gate Zones will be marked by 2.5 cm tape lines unless the imaginary lines are marked by tape. Each Gate Zone is approximately 50 cm by 50 cm square. The tape will be placed on the inside edge of the imaginary lines and/or the outer tape line to form the Gate Zone. The ES will select the locations of the Gate Zones. Each Gate Zone will be marked with a letter (Ex: “A”, “B”, “C”, ”D”, …).
viii. Water Bottles are placed on any imaginary line and approximately centered between perpendicular imaginary lines or outside boundary tape. The ES will select the locations of the Water Bottles.
ix. The Track Setup must contain a clear path that is free of 2x4 Obstacles to enter all Gate Zones, for the movement of Water Bottles to a Gate Zone, and reach the Target Point. A clear path would allow a Robot to achieve all the event goals and bonuses while the Robot remains completely inside the track boundary.
x. The color of the tape used to mark the track is the choice of the Event Supervisor.
xi. At the Event Supervisor’s discretion, more than one track may be used. If so, the team may choose which track they use. All runs must be on the same track.

ii. Competitors must demonstrate to the ES that they are only modifying the impounded source code file(s) to define the Robot’s motions.
iii. The Robot’s program can use libraries stored on the programming tool provided these libraries are not viewed or modified by the competitors during the event.
iv. Testing the Robot’s program on hardware other than the Robot is not permitted. Graphical software representations of the Track or the Robot’s motions are not permitted. Using software algorithms to modify the impounded program is not permitted.
v. An algorithm to find the optimal route is not allowed. Competitors must do the work to determine the route the Robot will take.
vi. The Robot must remain autonomous and not be remotely controlled. The Robot cannot receive external instructions or information once a run starts.
j. Trigger may be, but not limited to, a pushbutton, power switch, micro switch, or a sensor.
k. Entering Gate Zone is when the Robot’s dowel has fully entered a Gate Zone. The Robot may enter the Gate Zone forward, backwards, or sideways. Gate Zones can be entered in any order. Each Gate Zone will only be counted once.
l. Water Bottle is a 16.9 oz water bottle with a diameter between 6 and 7 cm and a height between 18 and 22 cm. The bottle’s weight will be between 80 to 100 grams. Metal (non-lead) BBs or similar will be used to increase the bottle’s weight. Liquids cannot be used.
m. Moving Water Bottle Restrictions are defined as:
i. The Bottle must remain in contact with the event floor at all times. No part of the Robot may extend under the Bottle.
ii. The Bottle may only be pushed or pulled around the track.
iii. The Robot cannot have a movable component with the intent to help relocate the Bottle. For example a gripper to grab or hold the Bottle is illegal.
n. Stalling Action is a delaying movement or series of movements near the Target Point with the intent to improve only the Time Score. Possible delaying actions can include but are not limited to: repeating a single or multiple movements, moving in small circles, or other motions designed to improve the Time Score only.
i. Near the Target Point is defined as occurring within the 50 cm by 50 cm Target Point square or any square surrounding the square with the Target Point.
ii. Pauses between motions will not be penalized. Unless the motions between the pauses are repetitive as for example moving in a straight line with more than one pause during the straight line motion.
iii. Varying the speed of the Robot during a Run is allowed and is not a Stalling Action.
iv. An Event Supervisor may request the last run to be repeated to verify the presence of delaying movements. This repeat run will not count toward the team’s Track Time or used for scoring.
o. Robot Distance is a point-to-point measurement from the Robot’s Measurement Point to the Target Point, measured to the nearest 0.1 cm.
p. Run Time begins when the Robot begins to move and ends when the Robot comes to a complete stop.
i. If the Robot does not move within 3 seconds after coming to a stop, the run is considered to have ended; the 3 seconds are not included in the Run Time. Any action occurring after that time does not count as part of the run.
ii. The Run Time is recorded in seconds to the precision of the timing device used.
iii. Three timekeepers should be utilized with the middle time used as the official Run Time.
q. Successful Run: Any run when the Robot moves before the end of the Event Time and has not met one of the Failed Run conditions.
r. Failed Run: A run will be scored as a Failed Run when one of the following occurs. Construction and/ or Competition Violations must still be recorded for Failed Runs.
i. Competitors may ask to have the run recorded as a Failed Run. The Robot must be in motion to be declared as a Failed Run. If competitors declare a Failed Run during the 3 seconds of non-motion, the Robot must make another motion after the pause to be declared as a Failed Run. Competitors may not collect information about where the Robot stopped.
ii. Does not finish within twice the Target Time.
iii. The Robot exits the track area as determined by all Robot floor contact points being completely outside of the Track’s outer perimeter lines.
iv. A competitor picks up the Robot after the Robot stops moving and before the ES gives permission to pick up the Robot. In addition, the team’s next successful run will receive a competition violation.
v. If the time and/or distance cannot be measured for a Robot (e.g., it starts before the ES is ready, the participants pick it up before it is measured).
vi. At the end of the Track Time, a team having less than 2 successful runs will have any remaining runs assessed as a Failed Run.
