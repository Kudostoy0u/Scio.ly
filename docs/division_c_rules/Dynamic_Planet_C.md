# Dynamic Planet C - Oceanography

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

1. DESCRIPTION: Teams will complete tasks related to physical and geological oceanography.

A TEAM OF UP TO: 2			APPROXIMATE TIME: 50 minutes
			
CALCULATOR: Class II

2. EVENT PARAMETERS:
a. Each team may bring a binder of any size containing information in any form and from any source attached using the available rings. Sheet protectors, lamination, tabs, and labels are permitted. If the event features a rotation through a series of laboratory stations where the participants interact with samples or displays; no material may be removed from the binder throughout the event.
b. Each team may bring two Class II calculators.

3. THE COMPETITION: Participants will be tested over the following topics in the form of an exam and/or timed stations:
a. Seawater properties’ distributions and the processes affecting them:
i. Temperature (e.g. thermocline, sea surface temperature)
ii. Salinity (e.g. effect of water cycle, salt sources)
iii. Pressure & density (e.g. three-layer model, stratification, mixing)
iv. Other properties (e.g. nutrient concentrations, pH, chlorophyll)
b. Surface circulation:
i. Warm and cool currents
ii. Coriolis effect
iii. Surface convergence and divergence
iv. Western intensification
v. Ekman transport
v. Eddies
c. Large-scale circulation:
i. Thermohaline circulation
ii. Global ocean energy transport
iii. Water masses and fronts
iv. Deep water formation
d. Waves:
i. Wave types (e.g. wind waves, tsunamis, storm surge) & their formation
ii. Wave interaction with coasts (e.g. surf, wave shoaling)
iii. Related properties, including but not limited to wave velocity, wave height, wavelength, period, and fetch
e. Tides:
i. Diurnal/semidiurnal/mixed patterns
ii. Spring/neap tides
iii. Resonance
iv. Tidal currents
f. Coastal features and processes:
i. Estuaries
ii. Coastal erosional and depositional landforms
iii. Formations of coral reefs; atolls
iv. Longshore currents, rip currents
v. Coastal upwelling and downwelling
g. Geological oceanography:
i. Tectonic processes in ocean basins (e.g. seafloor spreading and associated evidence, oceanic crust composition and evolution)
ii. Ocean floor features (e.g. ridges, seamounts, trenches, continental rise/slope/shelf)
iii. Oceanic sediment (e.g. sediment types, turbidity currents/turbidites, abyssal plains)
h. Climate variability and change:
i. Atmosphere/ocean variability, limited to El Niño Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Southern Annular Mode
ii. Ocean climate change effects (e.g. sea level rise, thermal expansion, coastal flooding, acidification, deoxygenation)
i. Oceanic tools used for research (e.g. water samples, sediment cores, seawater velocity trackers, sonar and acoustic sensing, CTD devices)
j. Pressure-gradient force, geostrophic balance, Rossby waves, Kelvin waves

4. SCORING: Points will be awarded for the quality and accuracy of responses. High score wins. Ties will be broken by the accuracy and/or quality of answers to selected questions.
Recommended Resources: The Science Olympiad Store (store.soinc.org) carries a variety of resources to purchase; other resources are available on the Event Pages at soinc.org.
In partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the North American Association for Environmental Education (NAAEE)
