# Protein Modeling C

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

1. DESCRIPTION: Teams will analyze information about protein structure and function, and then use provided materials to build a physical model of a specific protein or protein segment.

A TEAM OF UP TO: 2
			APPROXIMATE TIME: 50 minutes
EYE PROTECTION: None			CALCULATOR: Class II

2. EVENT PARAMETERS:
a. Each team may bring writing utensils.
b. Each team may bring two (2) Class II calculators.
c. Each team may bring one (1) 8.5” x 11” sheet of paper that may contain information on both sides in any form and from any source. The sheet of paper may be laminated or placed in a sheet protector to increase durability. Affixed labels, as well as multiple sheets of paper (whether in a single sheet protector or not) are prohibited.
d. All materials for building the protein model will be provided by the event supervisor. Teams are not allowed to bring their own modeling materials.
e. Teams may be given access to computer resources (e.g., protein databases, visualization software) during the event, as determined by the event supervisor and announced in advance. No external internet access or personal devices are permitted.

3. THE COMPETITION: The event will consist of two main parts: a written test/analysis section and a protein model building section.
Part I: Protein Analysis and Knowledge – 40% of the total score
a. This section will assess knowledge of protein structure (primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary), amino acids (types, properties), protein folding, and common protein functions (e.g., enzymes, structural, transport).
b. May include interpreting diagrams, sequences, or data related to protein characteristics.

Part II: Protein Model Building – 60% of the total score
a. Teams will be provided with a specific protein or a segment of a protein (e.g., amino acid sequence, PDB data, structural motifs) and a variety of modeling materials (e.g., pipe cleaners, beads, foam, magnets, wire).
b. Teams must construct a physical model that accurately represents the given protein’s structure, highlighting key features (e.g., alpha-helices, beta-sheets, active sites, disulfide bonds).
c. Teams will be asked to explain their model and how it relates to the protein’s function.

4. SCORING:
a. High score wins.
i. Part I will be scored based on correctness of answers.
ii. Part II will be scored based on the accuracy, completeness, and clarity of the physical model, as well as the explanation provided.
b. Selected questions or aspects of the model/explanation may be used as tiebreakers.

Recommended Resources: The Science Olympiad Store (store.soinc.org) carries a variety of resources to purchase; other resources are available on the Event Pages at soinc.org.
