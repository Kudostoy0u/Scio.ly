# Bungee Drop C

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

1. DESCRIPTION: Each team will design one elastic cord to conduct drops at a given height(s) and attempt to get a mass placed in a bottle as close as possible to, but without touching, a landing surface.

A TEAM OF UP TO: 2 			APPROXIMATE TIME: 10 minutes
EYE PROTECTION: B
IMPOUND: Yes		CALCULATOR: Class II

2. EVENT PARAMETERS:
a. Each team must impound only one elastic cord, calibration data (if prepared), and tools. The calibration data are the only papers or notes that the competitors may bring into the competition area and must be impounded. Any tools used by teams to confirm heights, lengths, or mass during the time given for preparing their two drops must also be impounded. Electric and electronic tools are allowed.
b. Teams may bring up to two Class II calculators, which do not need to be impounded.
c. After impound, the event supervisor must provide the
i. drop height values (for each height and bonus drop),
ii. light and heavy mass values,
iii. light and heavy mass lengths, and
iv. drop instructions.
d. Teams must be able to answer questions regarding the design, construction, and operation of the device per the Building Policy found on www.soinc.org.

3. CONSTRUCTION PARAMETERS:
a. Teams must provide one elastic cord to be used for both drops that terminates with a circular closed metal ring with an inner and outer diameter of 1.9 +/- 0.8 cm (e.g., a key ring) that will not open.
b. The cord may consist of more than one material (contest rubber, nylon, latex tubing, thread, sewing elastic, metal springs, etc.) and more than one strand.
c. No physical modifications may be made to the elastic cord once it has been impounded, with the exception of marking drop locations on the cord before the drops. Physical modifications after impound constitute a construction violation.
d. Elasticity Test: While being suspended vertically, the bottom 0.50 m of the cord, not including the metal ring, must stretch to at least 1.00 m when a single 500 g mass is attached to the metal ring and return to approximately its original length after the mass is removed.
e. No “self-limiting-brake” mechanisms such as a separate, parallel, non-elastic strand that “brakes” the fall of the mass with little to no rebound are used.

4. THE COMPETITION AREA:
a. Light and Heavy Mass:
i. Supervisors will supply a light mass and a heavy mass that will each be composed of a 500-591 mL plastic bottle, mass inside of the bottle, and an attachment mechanism (hook, clasp, carabiner, etc.) that will connect the team’s bottom cord ring to the bottle. When hung, the masses including the attachment mechanism will have a height of at most 35.0 cm.
ii. The light mass and heavy mass, individually, will be the same for all drops.
iii. The light mass will have a total mass between 100.0 g and 300.0 g and be in increments of 25.0 g at regionals, 10.0 g at states, and 1.0 g at nationals.
iv. The heavy mass will have a total mass between 200.0 g and 300.0 g heavier than the light mass, at increments of 1.0 g.
b. Drop Heights:
i. At Regionals, there will be two total drops at one drop height, which will be between 2.00 and 5.00 meters inclusive at an interval of 25.0 cm.
ii. At States, there will be four total drops - two drops at each of two different drop heights. Both drop heights will be between 2.00 and 5.00 meters inclusive at an interval of 10.0 cm.
iii. At Nationals there will be four total drops - two drops at each of two different drop heights. Both drop heights will be between 5.00 and 8.00 meters inclusive at an interval of 1.0 cm.
iv. The Bonus Drop will be an additional single drop, trying to drop close to a Bonus Target Drop Distance (BTDD), rather than the landing surface. The BTDD must be greater than 2.00 m and less than the drop height (regionals) or larger drop height (states/nationals).
v. The drop height will be measured from the bottom most point of the clamp/attachment portion at the top of the cord to the bottom landing surface.
c. Supervisors must provide a top anchoring system/extended platform with a release mechanism (e.g., a clamp) to attach to the top end of the elastic cord. All teams must use this anchoring system.
d. Supervisors must provide an accurate system for determining how close a team’s device came to the landing surface, and whether or not it touched.

5. THE COMPETITION:
a. Teams will be given a total of 3 minutes to prepare their device in the holding area, followed immediately by 7 minutes to complete up to two drops at regionals and up to four drops at states and nationals as well as up to one bonus drop, if earned.
b. At States/Nationals, teams will perform two drops at the lower Drop Height first, then perform two drops at the higher Drop Height, followed by the Bonus Drop if eligible, which will be completed on the higher Drop Height.
c. Practice drops either in the competition area or within the vicinity of the competition area before or during competition are not allowed. Any drop, even if unintended or unannounced, will count as one of the drops allowed to the team.
d. A cord that is damaged during a drop will earn a Drop Score of 0.5x the total drop height and any remaining drops will be scored as incomplete.
e. The Heavy Mass Bonus.
i. Teams can choose to attempt the heavy mass only on the 2nd drop for each drop height. If used, the heavy mass bonus earned will only apply to the drop(s) that used the heavy mass.
ii. Teams that would like to attempt the heavy mass will attach the heavy mass (described in 5.a.) at the same closed ring as the 1st drop at each drop height, replacing the original light mass.
f. The Bonus Drop.
i. Teams with a drop score within the following parameters (30.0 pts at regionals, 20.0 pts at states, 10.0 pts at nationals) must be invited to complete a single bonus drop at the BTDD. At Regionals, the Bonus Drop will be done using the same Drop Height setup. At States/Nationals, the Bonus Drop will be done on the higher of the two Drop Height setups.
ii. The bonus drop will consist of dropping the light mass so the bottom of the mass dips within (30.0 cm at regionals, 20.0 cm at states, 10.0 cm at nationals) of the BTDD without passing the BTDD.
iii. Teams can earn a maximum of one bonus drop and are given no additional time to complete the bonus drop.
iv. Teams are not allowed to use the heavy mass during a bonus drop.
g. The supervisor will review with the team the data recorded on their scoresheet.
h. Teams who wish to file an appeal must leave their device with the event supervisor.

6. SCORING:
a. Low score wins. Final Score (FS) = HS1 + HS2 (States/Nationals only) + BD. A scoring spreadsheet is available on the event page on www.soinc.org.
b. Height Score (HS) = The minimum DS for the two drops for each height.
c. Drop Score (DS) = Drop Distance + Bonus. If the heavy mass is used for that drop, -20.0 points is added to the Drop Score for that drop. The heavy drop bonus can only be applied to the 2nd run for each drop height and only if the mass does not strike the landing surface for that drop.
i. The Drop Distance is defined as the distance between the lowest point of the mass and the landing surface on its initial descent.
ii. A drop that strikes the landing surface will have a DS of 0.5x the drop height.
iii. Any drops not completed within the 7 minute test period will have a DS equal to the entire drop height.
d. Bonus Drop (BD) — If the bottom of the mass is dropped within the distance of the BTDD at its lowest point on the bonus drop (described in 6.e.ii.), BD = -15.0 points. Otherwise, BD = 0.0 points.
e. Devices will be placed in tiers as follows:
i. Tier 1: Device meets all construction parameters for all drops.
ii. Tier 2: Device still has construction parameter violation(s) during any drop.
iii. Tier 3: A team with its device and/or tools not impounded or uses calibration data notes that were not impounded.
f. Teams that are prohibited from launching due to unsafe operation will receive Participation Points only.
g. Tiebreakers:
i. 1st: Whether a team succeeded in the bonus drop.
ii. 2nd: The number of drops completed using the heavy mass.
iii. 3rd: The team with the lowest individual drop score for any of their drops (not including bonus drop).
iv. 4th: Lowest non-scored drop score.
