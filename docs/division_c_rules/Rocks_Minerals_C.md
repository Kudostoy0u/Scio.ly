# Rocks and Minerals C

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

1. DESCRIPTION: Teams will identify and classify rocks and minerals and demonstrate knowledge of how rocks and minerals help to understand geologic processes, interpretation of earth’s history, the development of natural resources, and use by society.

A TEAM OF UP TO: 2			APPROXIMATE TIME: 50 minutes
			
CALCULATOR: Class II

2. EVENT PARAMETERS:
a. Each team may bring one (1) magnifying glass and one (1) three-ring binder of any size containing information in any form and from any source attached using the available rings. Sheet protectors, lamination, tabs and labels are permitted.
b. Each team may also have one (1) commercially produced field guide which may be tabbed and annotated.

3. THE COMPETITION:
a. Emphasis will be placed upon task-oriented activities such as identification of rocks and minerals based on observations of properties and characteristics, interpretation of graphs and charts, and analyzing data.
b. Where possible, participants will move from station to station, with the length of time at each station predetermined and announced by the Event Supervisor. Participants may not return to stations but may change or add information to their original responses while at other stations.
c. Identification will be limited to specimens appearing on the Official Science Olympiad 2026 National Rocks and Minerals List, but other rocks or minerals may be used to illustrate key concepts.
d. If identification of a specimen is not possible through observation, key characteristics/properties of the specimen will be provided.
e. Identification of rocks and minerals should be at least 30% but not more than 50% of available points.
f. Questions/tasks will be balanced between rock and mineral topics.
g. Written descriptions of how a specimen might react if tested with hydrochloric acid (HCl) may be given. However, HCl will not be used or provided. Participants will not be allowed to do a taste test.

i. Rock Topics
i. Identification - specimens or images used should show observable characteristics. Where observable characteristics are insufficient to identify a specimen, other diagnostic characteristics will be provided (e.g., mineral composition of fine-grained igneous rocks, reaction to acid of chalk or diatomite)
ii. Classification - igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic including observable diagnostic characteristics that facilitate classification (e.g., glassy or vesicular texture in igneous; rounded grains, fossils, or layers in sedimentary; and foliation or banding in metamorphic)
