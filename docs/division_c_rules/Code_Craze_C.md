# Code Craze C

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

1. DESCRIPTION: Participants will be challenged to solve a series of coding problems using a designated programming language. The competition will assess problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and coding proficiency.

A TEAM OF UP TO: 2
			APPROXIMATE TIME: 50 minutes
EYE PROTECTION: None			CALCULATOR: Class IV

2. EVENT PARAMETERS:
a. Each team may bring writing utensils.
b. Each team may bring two (2) Class IV calculators.
c. Each team may bring one (1) 8.5” x 11” sheet of paper that may contain information on both sides in any form and from any source. The sheet of paper may be laminated or placed in a sheet protector to increase durability. Affixed labels, as well as multiple sheets of paper (whether in a single sheet protector or not) are prohibited.
d. Participants will be provided with computers and a designated programming environment. The allowed programming language(s) will be announced at least 30 days prior to the tournament on soinc.org.
e. No external devices capable of internet access or external communication are permitted. No personal laptops, tablets, or other similar devices may be used in the competition.

3. THE COMPETITION: The event will consist of a series of coding challenges of varying difficulty. Participants will be given a problem statement, input specifications, and expected output formats. They will write code to solve these problems within the allotted time. Scoring will be based on correctness, efficiency, and adherence to problem specifications.
Part I: Algorithmic Challenges – 40% of the total score
a. Participants will solve problems requiring common algorithms and data structures (e.g., sorting, searching, linked lists, trees, graphs).
b. Focus on understanding problem constraints and optimizing solutions for time and space complexity.

Part II: Logic and Problem Solving – 30% of the total score
a. Challenges will test logical reasoning and the ability to break down complex problems into manageable parts.
b. May include puzzles, pattern recognition, or simulation tasks.

Part III: Debugging and Code Analysis – 30% of the total score
a. Participants will identify and fix errors in provided code snippets.
b. Analyze given code for efficiency, correctness, and adherence to best practices.

4. SCORING:
a. High score wins.
i. Points will be awarded based on the number of test cases passed for each problem, as well as the efficiency of the solution (time and memory usage).
ii. Partial credit may be awarded for partially correct solutions.
b. Selected problems or test cases may be used as tiebreakers.
