# Eye Protection Guide C

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

This guide outlines the types of eye protection required for various Science Olympiad Division C events, as indicated by the Eye Protection ratings. It is imperative that all participants wear appropriate eye protection to ensure their safety and prevent disqualification.

## Eye Protection Ratings

- **None:** No eye protection is specifically required for this event. However, general safety practices should always be followed.

- **A:** Indirect vent chemical splash goggles. These goggles offer protection from chemical splashes and impacts from the front, sides, and bottom. They have indirect ventilation to prevent fogging while still protecting against splashes.

- **B:** Direct vent chemical splash goggles or safety glasses with side shields. Direct vent goggles provide splash and impact protection but have direct vents that may allow some vapor or fine splash entry. Safety glasses with side shields protect against impacts but offer less protection from splashes.

- **C:** Any type of eye protection (safety goggles, safety glasses, or a face shield). This rating indicates that some form of eye protection is required, but the specific type is flexible. The primary concern is protection from general hazards like flying debris or minor splashes.

- **D:** Welding goggles or full-face shield. This rating is for events with high-intensity light (e.g., welding, high-power lasers) or significant projectile hazards that require more comprehensive facial protection.

## General Eye Protection Rules

1. **Personal Responsibility:** Participants are responsible for bringing and wearing their own appropriate eye protection for events that require it. Event supervisors are not required to provide eye protection.

2. **Inspection:** Event supervisors will inspect eye protection to ensure it meets the specified rating for the event. Teams without proper eye protection will be immediately informed and given a chance to obtain appropriate eye protection if time allows. Failure to do so will result in disqualification from the event.

3. **Clarity and Condition:** Eye protection must be clean, in good repair, and provide clear vision. Heavily scratched, broken, or opaque eye protection is not acceptable.

4. **Fit:** Eye protection must fit properly to provide adequate protection. It should be worn securely over the eyes and, if applicable, fit comfortably over prescription glasses.

5. **Continuous Wear:** Once required, eye protection must be worn continuously during the event, from setup through testing and cleanup, until explicitly told otherwise by the event supervisor.

6. **Prescription Glasses:** Prescription glasses alone do not count as eye protection unless they are specifically designed to meet safety standards (e.g., ANSI Z87.1 rated) and have side shields.

7. **Event-Specific Details:** Always check the individual event rules for any specific nuances or additional requirements regarding eye protection.
