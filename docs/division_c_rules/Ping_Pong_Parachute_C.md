# Ping Pong Parachute C

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

1. DESCRIPTION: Teams will design, construct, and test a device to drop a ping-pong ball from a designated height, aiming for maximum airtime before landing in a target zone.

A TEAM OF UP TO: 2
			APPROXIMATE TIME: 50 minutes
EYE PROTECTION: C			CALCULATOR: None

2. EVENT PARAMETERS:
a. Each team may bring writing utensils.
b. Each team must bring one (1) ping-pong ball. The ping-pong ball must be a standard 40mm diameter and weigh between 2.67-2.77 grams. Balls will be inspected and may be replaced if not within specifications.
c. Each team may bring one (1) device constructed prior to the tournament. The device must be designed to hold and release the ping-pong ball, and must incorporate a parachute or similar air-resistance mechanism.
d. Device dimensions: The device, including the parachute, must fit within a 20 cm x 20 cm x 20 cm cube when fully collapsed/folded for impound. No part of the device may exceed these dimensions at any time before launch.
e. Materials: Devices may be constructed from any materials except those that are inherently dangerous (e.g., sharp metal, glass, hazardous chemicals). The parachute material must be flexible.
f. Eye protection (C) is required for all participants during device setup and testing. Teams without proper eye protection must be immediately informed and given a chance to obtain eye protection if time allows.

3. THE COMPETITION: Teams will impound their devices prior to the event. During their assigned time slot, teams will set up their device, load the ping-pong ball, and drop it from a designated height (e.g., 2-3 meters, announced at the tournament). Each team will have two (2) attempts. The event supervisor will measure the airtime and the landing zone.
Part I: Device Impound and Inspection – Prior to event
a. Devices will be impounded and inspected for adherence to all parameters (size, materials, ping-pong ball specifications).
b. Teams will not be allowed to make modifications to their device after impound.

Part II: Drop Procedure – During event
a. Teams will be given a designated drop zone and target area. The drop height will be clearly marked.
b. Participants will drop their device from the designated height. The device must release the ping-pong ball cleanly.
c. Airtime will be measured from the moment the ball is released from the device until it makes initial contact with the ground.
d. Landing accuracy: The landing zone will be a series of concentric circles on the ground. Points will be awarded based on how close the ping-pong ball lands to the center of the target.

4. SCORING:
a. The total score will be a combination of airtime and landing accuracy.
i. Airtime: The longest airtime from the two attempts will be used. Higher airtime receives more points.
ii. Landing Accuracy: Points awarded based on proximity to the center of the target. Closer is better.
b. High score wins.
c. In case of a tie, the team with the higher landing accuracy score will win. If still tied, the team with the higher airtime on their best accurate drop will win.
