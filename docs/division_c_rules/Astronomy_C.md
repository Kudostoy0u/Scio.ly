See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

1. DESCRIPTION: Teams will demonstrate an understanding of stellar evolution: From formation to destruction.

A TEAM OF UP TO: 2			APPROXIMATE TIME: 50 minutes
			
CALCULATOR: Class IV

2. EVENT PARAMETERS:
a. Each team may bring one of the following options containing information in any form from any source: a computer/tablet and a three-ring binder, two computers/tablets of any kind, or two three-ring binders.
b. If three ring binders are used, they may be of any size and the information contained should be attached using the available rings. The information or pages may be removed during the event. Sheet protectors and laminated sheets are allowed.
c. Each team may bring two stand-alone Class IV calculators. If the participants are using a computer or tablet, they may use the calculator app or other program on their device in place of a stand-alone calculator.
d. Participants using computers/tablets as a resource should have all information stored so that it is available to them offline. Unauthorized generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, DALL-E) are not allowed to be used to generate answers under any circumstances during the event. Teams may be asked to access a dedicated NASA image analysis website to answer some JS9 questions. If so, supervisors will provide an alternative (e.g., event supervisor-supplied computer) for teams that did not bring a laptop/tablet.

3. THE COMPETITION: Using information which may include Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams, spectra, light curves, motions, cosmological distance equations and relationships, stellar magnitudes and classification, multi-wavelength images (gamma-ray, X-ray, UV, optical, IR, radio), charts, graphs and JS9 imaging analysis tools, teams will compete in activities and answer questions related to:
a. Stellar evolution including stellar classification, spectral features and chemical composition, luminosity, blackbody radiation, spectroscopy, H-R diagram transitions, cold molecular clouds & star formation regions, protostars, T Tauri Variables, red giants, Mira variables, RR Lyrae variables, Cepheid variables, white dwarfs, planetary nebulas, neutron stars, pulsars, X-Ray binaries, and Type Ia and II supernovas.
b. Use orbital mechanics, Kepler’s laws, rotation and circular motion to answer questions relating to the orbital motions of binary and multiple star systems; use parallax, spectroscopic parallax, period-luminosity relations, and the distance modulus to calculate distances to RR Lyrae, Cepheids and Type Ia supernovas, and the Stefan-Boltzmann law to answer questions relating to the content areas outlined above.
c. Identify and answer questions relating to the content areas outlined above for the following objects: The Orion Molecular Cloud Complex, Sharpless 29 (NGC 6559), Ophion Star Family, HP Tau, Mira (Omicron Ceti), Helix Nebula (NGC 7293) Janus (ZTF J203349.8+322901.1), WDJ181058.67+311940.94, The Crab (M1), The Bone (G359.13), Cas A, Tycho’s SNR

4. SCORING: All questions will have been assigned a predetermined number of points. The highest score wins. Selected questions will be used to break ties.

Recommended Resources: The Science Olympiad Store (store.soinc.org) carries a variety of resources to purchase; other resources are available on the Event Pages at soinc.org.
