All of these functions are related to the distance from the center of the star, r. The value “dr” tells us the “difference of a small amount of r from one value to the next” to an almost infinitesimally small degree. P is the term for pressure, but dP essentially indicates the “difference of a small amount of P from one value to the next.” The ratio of dP/dr is like finding the slope for two points, only we made the change so small that it essentially looks like it is finding the slope off just one point. That is, how does a microscopic change in the CURRENT value for “r” change the CURRENT value of “P”? The equation on the right shows us that with functions all in terms of r. G is the gravitational constant, so yes, all units must be SI units for this equation to work.\nNow let’s consider how the mass of a spherical object would change when the radius changes. This basically is going to relate “dm” which is the difference in mass with respect to “dr.” If we increase “r” by a bit, then the next outer shell of the sphere will have more mass that is related to the surface area of the sphere. This gives an equation dm=4πρr dr, which should remind you of the surface area of a sphere. This works since when you add that extra “shell” on top with radius “dr”, you’re adding a shell that has a mass that is only quantifiable through a surface area since the change is so small.\nNow, the test is to combine the two equations to show dP/dm, the rate of change of pressure with respect to the rate of change in mass.","options":[],"answers":["dP/dm = -(Gm)/(4πr^4)"],"difficulty":1}]},{"forensics":[{"question":"Identify powder 1 + implications","options":[],"answers":["sodium chloride"],"difficulty":0.2},{"question":"Identify powder 2 + implications","options":[],"answers":["sodium carbonate"],"difficulty":0.2},{"question":"Identify powder 3 + implications","options":[],"answers":["sodium bicarbonate"],"difficulty":0.2},{"question":"Identify powder 4 + implications","options":[],"answers":["calcium chloride"],"difficulty":0.2},{"question":"Identify powder 5 + implications","options":[],"answers":["calcium carbonate"],"difficulty":0.2},{"question":"Identify powder 6 + implications","options":[],"answers":["magnesium hydroxide"],"difficulty":0.2},{"question":"Identify powder 7 + implications","options":[],"answers":["calcium hydroxide"],"difficulty":0.2},{"question":"Identify powder 8 + implications","options":[],"answers":["boric acid"],"difficulty":0.2},{"question":"Identify powder 9 + implications","options":[],"answers":["strontium chloride"],"difficulty":0.2},{"question":"Identify powder 10 + implications","options":[],"answers":["potassium nitrate"],"difficulty":0.2},{"question":"Identify powder 11 + implications","options":[],"answers":["starch"],"difficulty":0.2},{"question":"Identify powder 12 + implications","options":[],"answers":["copper sulfate"],"difficulty":0.2},{"question":"Explain the cause of colors from F[]ame tests on the atomic level","options":[],"answers":["When heat is applied, electrons jump to a higher energy level.

In the first dimension, a more polar solvent system would help to separate amino acids that are highly polar from those that are less polar. In the second dimension, a less polar solvent system is chosen to separate the amino acids that have co-migrated in the first dimension.
