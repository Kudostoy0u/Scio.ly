# Hovercraft B

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

1. DESCRIPTION: Prior to the competition, participants will design, construct, and calibrate a self-propelled air-levitated vehicle that moves down a track.
A TEAM OF UP TO: 2
			 APPROXIMATE TIME: 10 minutes
EYE PROTECTION: B
IMPOUND: Yes 		 CALCULATOR: Class III
2. EVENT PARAMETERS:
a. Each team must impound only one vehicle and any papers/notes needed during the competition time. The vehicle must be impounded with the batteries stored separately and presented to the Event Supervisor for inspection. No additional papers/notes may be brought into the competition area after impound.
b. Teams may bring tools, supplies, spare parts, eye protection, and two Class III calculators. These items need not be impounded.
c. Participants must wear eye protection during vehicle setup and operation. Teams without proper eye protection must be immediately informed and given a chance to obtain eye protection if time allows.
d. The Event Supervisor will provide the testing materials listed in the TRACK section. Teams should not bring their own track or ramp.
e. Participants must be able to answer questions regarding the design, construction, and operation of the vehicle per the Building Policy found on www.soinc.org.
3. CONSTRUCTION PARAMETERS:
a. The vehicle must fit into a 40.0 cm x 40.0 cm x 40.0 cm box when levitated in the ready-to-run configuration. Vehicles must not modify or damage the track.
b. The vehicle must levitate on a cushion of air as it moves down the track. Participants may be asked to demonstrate levitation by pushing the vehicle slightly down. If it then rises, it is levitating. Continuous contact of the inflated skirt with the base surface, occasional contact of other vehicle components with the base surface, or any contact with the inside edge of the side rails is permitted.
c. All propellers/impellers, including those under the vehicle, must have shielding that prevents a 3/8” dowel from touching them.
d. Commercial batteries, including rechargeables, not exceeding 12.0V as labeled, may be used to energize each of the vehicle’s motors. The label on each battery must be the manufacturer’s original and easily viewable by the Event Supervisor. Multiple batteries may be connected together as long as the expected voltage across any two points does not exceed 12.0V, as calculated by their individual labels. The vehicle must not have any other energy sources. Batteries containing lithium or lead are prohibited.
e. All motors must have a switch to permit safe starting and stopping. Relying on inserting batteries or twisting wires together to start is not allowed. If more than one motor is used, they may be combined on the same switch or wired on separate switches.
f. Electrical components shall be limited to batteries, wires, manually-operated switches, resistors, potentiometers, capacitors, and up to two motors (including brushless motors). Integrated circuits (other than those that are an integral part of a commercial motor) are not permitted.
g. For timing and measurement purposes, the vehicle must have a 1/4” or larger wooden dowel vertically attached within 3.0 cm of its front edge such that the top end is at least 20.0 cm above the track’s surface when levitated. The dowel must be placed on the hovercraft so that it will be the first part of the vehicle to break a laser timing beam when the vehicle is traveling forward.
4. THE COMPETITION:
a. Once participants enter the event area to compete, they must not leave or receive outside assistance, materials, or communication until they are finished competing.
b. Vehicles violating rules 3.c., 3.d., or 3.e. or that are otherwise deemed unsafe in construction or operation by the Event Supervisor will not be allowed to run unless brought into compliance. If the team is unable to bring the vehicle into compliance with 3.c., 3.d. and 3.e., the vehicle will not run and will receive a Final Score of zero (0). The Event Supervisor must complete the entire construction check on the vehicle to determine the total number of construction violations (which is used to break ties).
c. Event Supervisors will check the vehicle specifications before the team’s testing period. Teams must be notified as soon as possible if a vehicle is out of spec. Teams may modify the vehicle to bring it into compliance during their testing period.
d. At the start of their testing period, each team will be given a Target Time (TT). The Target Time will be between 10.0-20.0 seconds in intervals of 2.0 seconds for Regionals, 1.0 second for States, and 0.5 seconds for Nationals. The TT will be the same for all teams.
e. Teams have a testing period of 8 minutes to adjust and repair their vehicle and make their test runs. Practice runs are not allowed. If a team has 3 incomplete runs, their testing period is over. Once a team has one complete run, the team is allowed only one more run (the Final Run), regardless of the result of that run or whether the team has fewer than 3 incomplete runs.
f. An incomplete run occurs if a vehicle fails to move for 3 seconds before crossing the finish line or the dowel fails to cross the finish line within (2 x TT) seconds. Teams are not allowed to declare a run as incomplete.
g. If the vehicle’s dowel does not cross the starting line within 3 seconds of launching, it does not count as a run (either complete or incomplete) and teams may reset. A run will be counted in the scoring as long as it is started before the 8-minute period has elapsed.
h. If any part of the vehicle falls off during a run, the team incurs a competition penalty for the run.
i. To begin a run, the team will place their vehicle on the track fully behind the start line against a wood block provided by and placed by the Event Supervisor. The team then activates their vehicle’s motor(s).
j. If they choose, teams may utilize an Event Supervisor-provided ramp (as described in 6.e.) for the launching of their vehicle. In such cases, the Event Supervisor will place the ramp in the same position for all teams. Using the ramp will impact the team’s score (7.c.iii.), and the time for placing the ramp will come out of the 8-minute period. The team may change this decision for each run.
k. The team will give a countdown of “3, 2, 1, launch”; then the Event Supervisor will remove the wood block. Timing starts when the vehicle’s dowel crosses the start line and stops when the dowel crosses the finish line. If photogates are used, the dowel must be the first part of the vehicle to break the laser beams at both the start and finish lines.
l. The team must not touch their vehicle after the dowel crosses the starting line until the Event Supervisor states they may do so. If touched, the run is counted as a complete run with a DS and a TS of 0.
m. If a run is declared incomplete, the Event Supervisor will place the starting block in front of the hovercraft at the point where the run was declared incomplete to prevent the vehicle from moving. The ES will ask the competitors to turn off their vehicle without moving it, and the ES will then record the distance from the finish line to the position of the dowel. The team’s testing period time will halt while the Event Supervisor makes measurements and will resume when the measurement time is done.
n. If the team’s run time on their first complete run is within 25% of the TT (to the precision of the time-keeping device), the team may request that their Final Run be for bonus points. Before the team makes that decision, the Event Supervisor will give the team the Bonus Target Time (BTT) for their consideration. The BTT must be different from the TT for that run. The Bonus Target Time (BTT) is subject to the same parameters as listed in 5.d. and will be the same for all teams. Teams may not use the ramp for a Bonus Run.
o. The Event Supervisor will review with the team the data recorded on their scoresheet.
p. A team filing an appeal must leave their vehicle in the competition area.
5. THE TRACK:
a. The Event Supervisor will supply a 45.0 ± 0.5 cm wide and at least 240 cm long track on a non-carpeted smooth floor or other firm smooth base surface, such as a countertop or large board. The outside boundary of the track is composed of rails each with a height at least 30.0 mm (standard 2x4 framing studs or steel framing studs recommended). The Event Supervisor will also supply a cushioned barrier to stop vehicles and a wood block to hold the vehicle at the start line. Example setups are at www.soinc.org.
b. Each rail must be securely affixed to the floor, base, or each other.
c. The length of the timed portion of the track is fixed at 185.0 ± 0.5 cm. A start line must be marked that is at least 45.0 cm from the end of the track. The finish line must be marked 185.0 ± 0.5 cm from the start line and a cushioned barrier at least 5.0 cm past it must block the channel.
d. A photogate timing system is highly recommended. If used, the system will be installed at the start and finish lines with the beams at a height of 17.0 ± 2.0 cm. At least one manual timer should be used as a backup. If photogates are not being used, three timekeepers should be utilized with the median time used as the official Run Time; lasers are recommended to be placed at the start and finish lines so the timekeepers only have to watch for the flash of light as the dowel cuts through the laser beam. Time is recorded in seconds to the device precision if photogates are used, or to the tenth of a second if manual timers are used.
e. The Event Supervisor must provide a removable ramp that competitors may use for the launching of their vehicle. The ramp should have a smooth, flat surface and must span the width of the track between the rails. The height of the ramp is 5.0 ± 0.5 cm and the length of the ramp’s surface is 41.0 ± 0.5 cm. When the ramp is placed on the track, the edge where the vehicle exits the ramp must be 4.0 ± 0.5 cm behind the start line. At the bottom of the ramp, where it meets the track surface, the transition should be reasonably smooth, with a drop-off from the ramp surface to the track surface of no more than 4.0 mm. See www.soinc.org for information on how to build a ramp and track.
f. At the Event Supervisor’s discretion, more than one Track may be used. If so, the team may choose which Track they use but must use the same Track for all runs.
6. SCORING:
a. High score wins. Final Score (FS) = Highest Run Score (RS) + Bonus Score (BS), if any. A scoring spreadsheet is available at www.soinc.org.
b. Run Score = Distance Score (DS) + Time Score (TS)
c. Distance Score (DS):
i. Complete Run: Distance Score = 30
ii. Incomplete Run: Distance Score = 30 x (185 - distance from the finish line in cm / 185)
iii. If the ramp is utilized, the Distance Score is multiplied by 0.5 for that run.
d. Time Score (TS):
i. Runtime = Time from the Vehicle dowel crossing the start line until the dowel crosses the finish line
ii. Complete Run: Time Score = 60 x (1 - abs(Runtime - TT)/TT)
iii. Incomplete Run: Time Score = 0
iv. The smallest possible Time Score is 0.
e. Bonus Score (BS) = 15 x (1 - 1.5 x abs(Final Run runtime - BTT)/BTT)
i. The smallest possible Bonus Score (BS) is 0.
ii. If the vehicle does not cross the finish line on the bonus run, the Bonus Score (BS) is 0.
f. Teams without any runs will receive a Final Score of 0, with ties broken as indicated in 7.j. Ties are possible.
g. The TS, DS, and BS for each run will be multiplied by 0.7 if the team misses impound.
h. The TS, DS, and BS for a run will be multiplied by 0.8 for each CONSTRUCTION violation present during that run.
i. The TS, DS, and BS for a run will be multiplied by 0.9 for each COMPETITION violation present during that run.
j. Tiebreakers: 1st – Best TS for the first complete run; 2nd – Fewest # Construction Violations; 3rd – Best BS, 4th - 2nd Best Run Score
