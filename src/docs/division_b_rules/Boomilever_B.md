g. Base vs. Load Scored Bonus Options:
i. Base Option:
(1) During the Competition testing, the Boomilever may ONLY touch the Testing Wall BETWEEN the 15 cm and 20 cm Horizontal Contact Depth Lines (6.b.) and
(2) Prior to loading sand, the bottom of the Loading Block must be supported ABOVE the horizontal plane extending from the 20 cm Horizontal Contact Depth Line (6.b).
ii. - OR - Load Scored BONUS option scored if the following requirements are met in place of 3.g.i.:
(1) During the Competition testing, the Boomilever may ONLY touch the Testing Wall ABOVE the 15 cm Horizontal Contact Depth Line (6.b.) and
(2) Prior to loading sand, the bottom of the Loading Block must be supported ABOVE the horizontal plane extending from the 15 cm Horizontal Contact Depth Line (6.b.) and
(3) The structure must hold 15 kg.
4. COMPETITION:
a. Prior to competition, the Event Supervisor will:
i. Verify all Test Apparatus are available and properly set-up per section 6.
ii. Verify the mass of the Loading Assembly meets requirements of 6.c.v.
iii. Verify that the combined mass of the Loading Assembly (6.c.) and sand (6.d.) is at least 15,100 g. but no more than 15,200 g.
b. Check-in:
i. Once participants begin check-in they may NOT leave or gain any outside assistance, materials or communications (including cell phone communication) until Testing is completed.
ii. No alterations may be made once check-in begins.
iii. Event Supervisor or Assistant will begin check-in:
(1) Verify participants have proper Eye Protection (2.b.).
(2) Inspect Structure design and construction materials (3.a., 3.b.).
(3) Teams will submit their Estimated Load Supported (4.c.vi.) to be used as a tie breaker (5.e.).
(4) Participants place structure on the Structure Scale (6.f.) so the Event Supervisor or Assistant can determine the structure mass to the nearest 0.01 gram or best precision available.
c. Testing
i. Teams will have 6 minutes to set up and test their Structure on the Testing Wall with the Loading Assembly. If necessary, participants may disassemble the Loading Assembly but must reassemble in the same order as presented by the Event Supervisor (6.c.). The bucket must be mounted to allow enough clearance above the floor for the bucket to tilt or the Structure to deflect.
ii. The Event Supervisor will check before loading with sand begins:
(1) Conformity to the requirements 3.c., 3.d., 3.e., 3.f.
(2) Conformity to requirements 3.g.i. or 3.g.ii. to determine if structure meets construction requirements for Load Scored Bonus.
(3) The bucket is suspended to have clearance above the floor for testing.
iii. Structure may not be adjusted once loading of sand has begun.
iv. Participants will load sand. Bucket may only be stabilized from movement by the tips of Bucket Stabilizing Sticks (6.e.).
v. Loading stops immediately when the Structure fails, the load is supported by anything other than the Structure, or time expires. At the Supervisors discretion, sand may be removed from the bucket if pouring continued after the Structure fails or time expires.
vi. Load Supported is determined and recorded to the nearest gram. Load Supported is the combined mass of the Loading Assembly (6.c.) and Sand (6.d.) in the Bucket, with any parts of the Structure in the Bucket removed prior to measurement.
vii. The Minimum Load Supported is the mass of the Loading Assembly (6.c.). If a Structure cannot hold the Loading Assembly (6.c.), the Structure is placed in Tier 3, unable to be loaded.
viii. The Maximum Load Supported is 15,000 g.
ix. Test Data Review. The Event Supervisor will review with the team the data recorded on their scoresheet. Once data is acknowledged by the team, the Testing is complete.
x. Teams who wish to file an appeal must leave their structure with the Event Supervisor.
5. SCORING:
a. High Score Wins. Score = Load Scored (5.c.)/ Structure Mass (4.b.iii.4.).
b. Load Scored Bonus: meeting the Load Scored BONUS construction parameters (3.f.ii.). Bonus = 5,000 g.
c. Load Scored = Load Supported (4.c.vi.) + Load Scored Bonus (5.b.).
d. Structures will be placed in one of 3 tiers.
i. Tier 1: meeting all construction and competition requirements.
ii. Tier 2: NOT meeting any one or more of the construction and/or competition requirements.
iii. Tier 3: Unable to be loaded, not supporting the minimum load (4.c.vii.), or no eye protection. Ranked by the mass of the structure from lowest structure mass to heaviest.
e. Tiebreakers
i. Estimated Load Supported: closest to actual load supported.
ii. Lowest Structure mass.
6. TEST APPARATUS:
a. In-Person tournaments: The Event Supervisor will provide all Test Apparatus. At the Event Supervisor’s discretion, more than one Test Apparatus may be used.
b. The Testing Wall
i. Solid and rigid surface at least 40.0 cm wide x 30.0 cm high. Constructed of ¾” grade plywood or other suitable material, with a smooth, hard, low friction surface that does not bend when loaded. The Testing Wall must be adjusted to be plumb vertical by the Event Supervisor utilizing a 9” torpedo level or similar method.
ii. One Mounting Bolt hole no larger than 0.266-inch diameter must be drilled through the wall located approximately 5.0 cm below the top of the Testing Wall and halfway between the sides of the wall. The horizontal and vertical centerlines of the Mounting Bolt hole must be marked on the face of the Testing Wall.
iii. Horizontal Contact Depth Lines must be clearly visible on the Testing Wall. They must be drawn at 10 cm, 15 cm, and 20 cm and below the center of the Mounting Bolt hole.
iv. Two vertical Contact Width Lines must be clearly visible on the Testing Wall. They will be drawn 4.0 cm to the right and left side of the center of the Mounting Bolt hole.
