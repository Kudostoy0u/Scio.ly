# Div. B Chemistry Lab Equipment List B

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

The Division B Chemistry Lab Equipment List is not explicitly provided in the text. However, based on the previous Division C task and the general structure of Science Olympiad rules, it would typically contain a list of allowed and disallowed equipment for chemistry-related events in Division B. Since the content is not in the provided text, I will create a placeholder file and indicate that the content needs to be filled in from an official source.

**Note:** This section is a placeholder. Please refer to the official Science Olympiad website (soinc.org) for the most current and accurate Division B Chemistry Lab Equipment List.
