# Botany B

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

1. DESCRIPTION: This event is about plant anatomy, physiology, and taxonomy.
A TEAM OF UP TO: 2
APPROXIMATE TIME: 50 minutes
CALCULATOR: Class II
2. EVENT PARAMETERS:
a. Each team may bring writing utensils.
b. Each team may bring two Class II calculators.
c. Each team may bring one (1) 8.5” x 11” sheet of paper that may contain information on both sides in any form and from any source. The sheet of paper may be laminated or placed in a sheet protector to increase durability. Affixed labels, as well as multiple sheets of paper (whether in a single sheet protector or not) are prohibited.
3. THE COMPETITION:
This Event will be administered as a written test which may be arranged in stations. Questions will emphasize process skills such as quantitative reasoning, making calculations, analyzing and interpreting experimental results, and drawing evidence-based conclusions. The Event will cover topics a.i. - a.iv. without overemphasis on any one particular topic. The list of topics and subtopics should be considered exhaustive.
a. For each of the following topics, participants will be expected to use quantitative reasoning and computational skills, analyze and interpret experimental results, and draw evidence-based conclusions.
i. Plant Anatomy: (1) Identify and describe the major parts of a plant: roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds. (2) Explain the functions of each major plant part. (3) Identify and describe the major plant tissues: dermal, ground, and vascular (xylem and phloem). (4) State and Nationals only: Understand the detailed anatomy of a flower, including sepals, petals, stamens (anther and filament), pistil/carpel (stigma, style, and ovary), and their roles in reproduction.
ii. Plant Physiology: (1) Understand the process of photosynthesis: inputs, outputs, and key stages (light-dependent and light-independent reactions). (2) Explain cellular respiration in plants: inputs, outputs, and key stages (glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation). (3) Understand water transport in plants: transpiration, cohesion-tension theory, and the role of xylem. (4) Understand nutrient uptake and transport: role of root hairs, mycorrhizae, and phloem in sugar transport. (5) State and Nationals only: Understand plant hormones (e.g., auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid, ethylene) and their effects on plant growth and development.
iii. Plant Taxonomy & Classification: (1) Understand the hierarchical classification of plants (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species). (2) Identify major plant groups: bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms, and their key characteristics. (3) State and Nationals only: Identify common plant families (e.g., Poaceae, Rosaceae, Fabaceae, Asteraceae, Solanaceae) based on their distinguishing characteristics and representative examples.
iv. Plant Ecology & Adaptations: (1) Understand different plant adaptations to various environments (e.g., xerophytes, hydrophytes, halophytes). (2) Explain plant responses to environmental stimuli (e.g., phototropism, gravitropism, thigmotropism, photoperiodism). (3) Understand plant interactions with other organisms (e.g., pollination, herbivory, symbiosis). (4) State and Nationals only: Discuss the role of plants in ecosystems (e.g., primary producers, carbon cycle, water cycle) and the impact of climate change on plant communities.
4. SCORING:
a. High score wins. Selected questions may be used as tiebreakers.
b. Points will be awarded for quality and accuracy of answers, quality of supporting reasoning, and the use of proper scientific methods.
Recommended Resources: The Science Olympiad Store (store.soinc.org) carries a variety of resources to purchase; other resources are available on the Event Pages at soinc.org.
