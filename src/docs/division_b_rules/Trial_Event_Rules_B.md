# Trial Event Rules B

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

Trial Events are created by a local or state Science Olympiad organization for a single tournament. They are not official National Science Olympiad events and are not part of the bid process to determine future events. Teams will be notified by their Tournament Director if there are any Trial Events at their tournament. Often, they are used to test out potential new National events. This means that the rules for Trial Events are often not as complete as official Science Olympiad events and often there are not many resources. In most tournaments, Trial Events do not count in the final team score. Awards, if any, for Trial Events may be given at the discretion of the Tournament Director. Participants and coaches should understand these aspects of Trial Events when preparing for them.
