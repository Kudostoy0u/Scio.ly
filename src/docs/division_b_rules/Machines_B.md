# Machines B

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

1. DESCRIPTION: Teams will construct a lever-based measuring device prior to the tournament to determine the mass ratios between three test masses and complete a written test on simple and compound machine concepts.
A TEAM OF UP TO: 2
			 APPROXIMATE TIME: 50 minutes
			
CALCULATOR: Class III
2. EVENT PARAMETERS:
a. Each team may bring a collection of notes and resources, written/printed on paper, of any size containing information in any form and from any source. Binders, notebooks, folders, sheet protectors, lamination, tabs, and labels are permitted. Participants are responsible for organizing and containing their notes efficiently. They may separate or remove the pages from containers for use during any part of the event.
b. Each team may also bring non-electronic tools and supplies, writing utensils, and two Class III calculators for use during any part of the event.
c. Each team may bring one pre-constructed device.
d. The Event Supervisors will provide the testing materials listed in the COMPETITION AREA section. Teams should not bring these materials.
e. Participants must be able to answer questions regarding the design, construction, and operation of the device per the Building Policy found on www.soinc.org.
3. CONSTRUCTION PARAMETERS:
a. The device must be a class 1 lever with a single “beam” that measures no longer than 80.0 cm. The “beam” is the bar that rests on the fulcrum and includes any attached components. Its length should be measured along the overall longest edge of the beam and is measured irrespective of the location of the test mass attachment points. It is measured without the supervisor-provided test masses attached.
b. Springs, electric components, and electronic components are prohibited.
c. The device must be constructed to accommodate the test masses as described in the COMPETITION AREA.
d. Participants must not bring masses or include them in their device except when fixed in place prior to testing to obtain static equilibrium. Lightweight adjustable hooks that may be moved along the beam and are used solely to accommodate the test masses are allowed and need not be fixed in place.
4. COMPETITION AREA:
a. The Event Supervisor will provide the testing materials listed below. The Event Supervisor must ensure that the mass measurements of the test masses and the ratios between those mass measurements are not revealed to any teams.
b. Event Supervisors will supply three test masses labeled A, B, and C. A flexible loop, large enough to pass a standard golf ball through, must be tied to the top of each test mass. The loops may be made from fishing line, zip ties, string, etc. Each test mass, including the fully stretched out flexible loop, must be able to fit inside a 15.0 cm x 15.0 cm x 20.0 cm box. Each test mass, including the loop and container, must be between 20.0 g and 800.0 g. The ratio of the heaviest test mass to the lightest test mass must not exceed the following limits:
Regionals
States
Nationals
4.0
5.5
7.0
c. The event supervisor may provide multiple testing stations, each with its own sets of test masses. The mass ratios between the test masses at each station must be identical to the precision that the Event Supervisor indicates in 5.II.g. The actual mass measurements of A, B, and C at each station must be roughly identical.
d. An example where the Event Supervisor uses multiple stations and asks for a precision in the submitted ratios of one decimal point:
i. Station 1: B1 has a mass of 300.0 g, A1 has a mass of 100.0 g. B1/A1 = 3.0
ii. Allowed at Station 2:
(1) B2 has a mass of 300.5, A2 has a mass of 99.8g.
(2) B1/A1 = B2/A2 = 3.0 to the correct precision = Identical mass ratios. The actual masses are roughly identical. So this is allowed in 4.c.
iii. Disallowed at Station 2:
(1) B2 has a mass of 600.0 g, A2 has a mass of 200.0 g.
(2) B1/A1 = B2/A2 = 3.0 = Identical mass ratios. However, the actual masses are not roughly identical. This is not allowed in 4.c.
5. THE COMPETITION:
Part I: Written Test
a. Teams will be given a minimum of 25 minutes to complete a written test.
b. Unless otherwise requested, answers must be in metric units with appropriate significant figures.
c. The written test will consist of questions about simple machines in static equilibrium and include questions from each of the following topics as they apply to simple machines:
i. Ideal and actual mechanical advantage
ii. Efficiency, load, and effort
iii. Potential and kinetic energy
iv. Coefficient of friction
v. States/Nationals Only: Each topic area may be expanded to apply to compound machines.
d. At least six of the following simple machines must appear in questions: First class levers, second class levers, third class levers, inclined planes, wedges, wheel and axle (including gears), pulleys (including rope and pulley systems), and screws.
e. Questions dealing with the topics listed above may require additional knowledge from the field of classical Newtonian mechanics, including Newton’s laws of motion, inertia, force, action-reaction, position, speed, velocity, acceleration, momentum, kinetic and potential energy, and conservation of energy and momentum.
f. Questions on the test will use the following mathematical content:
i. Standard arithmetic operations (including ratios).
ii. Simple algebra manipulations, including solving one equation for one variable.
iii. Basic 2D geometry required for resolving forces into component parts. For example, parallel & perpendicular lines, triangles (right, similar, & congruent), and the basics of vectors.
iv. Simple trigonometric relations to enable use of trigonometric functions on a calculator. For example, to resolve forces into component parts. No angles in radians.
Part II: Device Testing
a. The objective is to quickly determine the ratios of the unknown masses of the three test masses using their simple lever. Teams may not submit a ratio guess that is based on visual inspection or hefting the test masses in their hands; teams must use their lever to make an honest attempt to measure the ratio. Otherwise teams will receive zero (0) ratio and time scores.
b. While all teams are working on Part I, the Event Supervisor will individually call each team for Device Setup and Testing. Depending on the room’s space, this may be done where the team is working on their written test or at a separate station in the room. If possible, students should not be asked to move their devices after Setup. Multiple stations may be used subject to the limitations in 4.c.
c. When called, teams will begin their Setup Time (Regional - 5 minutes, States/National - 4 minutes). Their Setup Time includes unpacking, assembly, and calibration of the device. The Event Supervisor will pause the time to check the device specifications after the device is assembled. Teams must be notified as soon as possible if a device does not meet specifications.
d. Teams may modify the device to bring it into compliance with construction specifications during their Setup Time, but will receive no additional time for setup.
i. If teams have brought a beam that is too long, they may measure out an “allowed beam length” and mark it with Event Supervisor-provided masking tape. The “allowed beam length” must meet the construction specifications in Section 3 and must include the fulcrum, means and space to attach the Event Supervisor-provided test masses, and any fixed masses. Teams may then test without penalty using only the “allowed” part of their beam.
ii. If teams bring movable masses (in violation of 3.d.), they may, without penalty, fix them in place with the masking tape.
iii. Modifications of the device, other than those listed here, may be performed during Setup.
iv. The Event Supervisor does not pause the Setup Time for a construction re-check if the team has to fix construction parameters. If teams cannot bring their device into compliance with the Construction Parameters by the end of their Setup Time, the team may elect to reduce their allowed time in their Device Test time to continue to address the issue(s).
e. Teams will be given 4 minutes of Device Test time, minus any overage time from Setup, to calculate their mass ratios. Teams must not touch the test masses until handed them by the Event Supervisor. Test masses must not be handed to teams until their device is brought into specification.
f. Using the basic physical principles of a lever and adjusting only the relative positions of the test masses and/or fulcrum along the lever beam, teams must calculate the ratios of the masses of the test masses. Teams may work with either two or three test masses at a time. Teams may use their resources, calculators, and tools to determine the mass ratios.
g. Teams will submit their mass ratios in decimal form (ex. a ratio of 5:2 should be written as 2.5). The Event Supervisor will inform teams of the precision to which the team should give their answers. The Event Supervisor will also inform teams what action makes their ratios “submitted” for the time to stop (for example, writing the second ratio down on the scoresheet, announcing that their answers are final, ringing a bell, etc).
h. Teams must not mark on, attach anything to, or modify the test masses.
i. Part II timing stops when the team submits the calculated mass ratios A/B and B/C or their Device Testing Time has elapsed. Event Supervisors must record the elapsed time in seconds to the nearest tenth of a second. No changes are allowed to the calculated values once timing stops.
j. The Supervisor will review with the team the Part II data recorded on their scoresheet.
k. Teams filing an appeal regarding Part II must leave their device in the competition area.
6. SCORING:
a. High score wins; Final Score (FS) = ES + R1 + R2 + TS. The maximum possible FS is 100 points. A scoring spreadsheet is available at www.soinc.org.
b. Exam Score (ES) = (Part I score / Highest Part I score for all teams) x 45 points.
c. Time Score (TS) = ((240 - team’s part II time in seconds) / 240) x 15 points.
d. Ratio Scores (R1 and R2) = (1 - (abs(AR - MR) / AR)) x 20 points.
i. AR is the actual ratio of two of the test masses.
ii. MR is the measured value of the ratio as submitted by the team.
iii. R1 uses mass ratio A/B, R2 uses mass ratio B/C.
iv. The smallest possible R1 and R2 is 0.
e. If a team violates a COMPETITION rule, their TS, R1, and R2 scores will be multiplied by 0.9.
f. Teams with no device, no ratio estimates, whose device cannot meet construction specifications, or that do not make an honest attempt to utilize a device of the prescribed type to determine the mass ratios receive R1, R2, and TS of 0. Such teams will be allowed to compete in Part I (the written test).
g. Tiebreakers: 1st - Best ES; 2nd - Best TS; 3rd - Best R1; 4th - Selected test questions.
