# Botany C

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

1. DESCRIPTION: Participants will be assessed on their understanding and knowledge of plants as described in the topic list below. There will be stations, written questions, and/or problem-solving scenarios.

A TEAM OF UP TO: 2
			APPROXIMATE TIME: 50 minutes
EYE PROTECTION: None			CALCULATOR: Class I

2. EVENT PARAMETERS:
a. Each team may bring writing utensils.
b. Each team may bring two (2) Class I calculators.
c. Each team may bring one (1) 8.5” x 11” sheet of paper that may contain information on both sides in any form and from any source. The sheet of paper may be laminated or placed in a sheet protector to increase durability. Affixed labels, as well as multiple sheets of paper (whether in a single sheet protector or not) are prohibited.
d. Any plant specimen presented must meet all local, state, and federal laws. Living organisms, except those found as part of a station, are not permitted unless allowed by the event supervisor. Participants may not bring their own plants or parts of plants.

3. THE COMPETITION: This event will consist of a series of stations, written questions, and/or problem-solving scenarios related to the topics listed below. The focus will be on the structure, function, and processes of plants. This event will also assess plant identification, plant ecology, and basic plant taxonomy (common names).
Part I: Plant Structure and Function – 40% of the total score
a. Plant Cells and Tissues: Basic cell structures, tissue types (meristematic, dermal, ground, vascular).
b. Plant Organs: Roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds – structure and function.
c. Photosynthesis and Respiration: Overview of processes, factors affecting rates.
d. Transpiration and Water Transport: Mechanisms of water movement, factors affecting transpiration.
e. Plant Hormones: Major types (auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid, ethylene) and their effects.

Part II: Plant Diversity and Classification – 30% of the total score
a. Major Plant Groups: Bryophytes (mosses, liverworts), Pteridophytes (ferns), Gymnosperms (conifers), Angiosperms (flowering plants) – distinguishing characteristics and examples.
b. Plant Identification: Identification of common plants based on morphological features (leaves, flowers, fruits) from a provided list or specimens (no official list is provided, but common local plants are expected).
c. Basic Plant Taxonomy: Understanding of binomial nomenclature and hierarchical classification (family, genus, species).

Part III: Plant Ecology and Adaptations – 30% of the total score
a. Plant Adaptations: Adaptations to various environments (e.g., deserts, aquatic, epiphytic, carnivorous plants).
b. Plant Reproduction: Sexual (pollination, fertilization, seed dispersal) and asexual reproduction (vegetative propagation).
c. Plant-Animal Interactions: Pollination syndromes, herbivory, symbiosis.
d. Plant Communities: Succession, competition, resource partitioning.
e. Economic and Ecological Importance: Role of plants in ecosystems, human uses (food, medicine, materials).

4. SCORING:
a. High score wins.
b. Selected questions or stations may be used as tiebreakers.
