# Trial Event Rules Explanation C

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

Science Olympiad periodically offers new events as "Trial Events." These events are generally being considered for addition to the regular slate of Science Olympiad events in future years. Rules for Trial Events typically are written to determine whether the event provides an interesting, valid, and fair competition as well as being feasible to run in a typical tournament setting. Because they are "trials," the following conditions apply.

1. Trial Events are subject to revision at any time. While efforts will be made to publicize significant revisions at soinc.org, there is no guarantee that they will be publicized in advance. Official Trial Event Rules are always the ones posted at soinc.org.
2. Trial Events are generally offered at Invitational and State Tournaments at the discretion of the Tournament Director and State Director. They may or may not be offered at every Invitational Tournament in a given state, nor at every State Tournament in a given year.
3. Scoring for Trial Events can be modified at any time at the discretion of the Tournament Director. No appeals will be heard concerning scoring on Trial Events.
4. Trial Events will not be run at the National Tournament unless an announcement has been made at soinc.org prior to the National Tournament. No Trial Event medals will be awarded at the National Tournament.
