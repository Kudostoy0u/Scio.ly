National Level Only:
xii. Electrophysiology: Understand the cable theory model of the neuron and modeling the neuron as a basic RC circuit, Quantitative models of the action potential (e.g. Hodgkin-Huxley model) and spiking neuron models
xiii. The Brain: Understand the detailed structure and function of the cerebral vasculature, including the internal carotid arteries, vertebral arteries, basilar artery, Circle of Willis, anterior cerebral artery (ACA), middle cerebral artery (MCA), posterior cerebral artery (PCA), superior cerebellar artery (SCA), anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA), and posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA).
xiv. Treatments and prevention for all conditions listed above (risk factors, medications, surgical treatment, etc.)
b. Special Senses: All levels should understand
i. Anatomy and Physiology of Sight
(1) Identify and describe the major parts of the eye: cornea, lens, iris, pupil, retina, optic nerve, and their functions.
(2) Explain how light enters the eye and is focused on the retina, and the role of rods and cones in detecting light and color.
ii. Anatomy and Physiology of Hearing and Balance
(1) Identify the major parts of the ear: outer ear (pinna, ear canal), middle ear (eardrum, ossicles), inner ear (cochlea, semicircular canals) and their functions.
(2) Describe how hair cells and the cochlea detect sound frequency and amplitude
(3) Describe the semicircular canals and vestibular system in the inner ear and how they contribute to balance and spatial orientation.
iii. Anatomy and Physiology of Smell
(1) Identify the major structures involved in smell: the nasal cavity, olfactory epithelium, olfactory receptor cells, and olfactory bulb.
(2) Describe how odor molecules bind to olfactory receptors in the nasal cavity, initiating the sense of smell.
iv. Anatomy and Physiology of Taste
(1) Identify the major structures involved in taste: tongue, taste buds, papillae, taste receptor cells, and gustatory nerves.
v. Disorders: myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia, nyctalopia, astigmatism, conjunctivitis, color blindness, otitis externa, otitis media, types of deafness, anosmia/dysosmia, dysgeusia
State & National Level Only:
vi. Anatomy and Physiology of Sight
(1) Explain the pathway of visual signal transmission from the retina through the optic nerve, optic chiasm, and optic tracts to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and visual cortex.
(2) Describe how the visual fields are processed in each hemisphere of the brain and how damage at different points along this pathway (e.g., optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic tract) can lead to specific visual field defects like monocular blindness, bitemporal hemianopia, or homonymous hemianopia.
National Level Only:
vii. Anatomy and Physiology of Sight
(1) Describe the neural pathway involved in pupillary control, including the role of the pretectal nucleus, Edinger-Westphal nucleus, and oculomotor nerve in the pupillary light reflex.
(2) Explain how light entering the eye triggers constriction of the pupil (miosis) through the parasympathetic system, and how dilation (mydriasis) occurs via the sympathetic pathway.
