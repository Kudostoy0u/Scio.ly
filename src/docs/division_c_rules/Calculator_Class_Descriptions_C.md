# Calculator Class Descriptions C

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

This document describes the calculator classes referred to in Science Olympiad event rules. It is crucial to understand these distinctions to ensure fair play and prevent disqualification. Event supervisors will strictly enforce these rules.

## Calculator Class I
- **Definition:** Any stand-alone non-programmable, non-graphing calculator that does NOT have the ability to store formulas or text. This includes four-function, scientific, and basic financial calculators.
- **Examples:** TI-30Xa, Casio fx-260 Solar II.
- **Restrictions:** No advanced statistical functions that are not built-in, no graphing capabilities, no programming features, no memory storage for text or formulas beyond basic arithmetic operations. No communication capabilities.

## Calculator Class II
- **Definition:** Any stand-alone non-programmable, graphing calculator that does NOT have the ability to store formulas or text.
- **Examples:** TI-83 Plus, TI-84 Plus, Casio fx-9750GII.
- **Restrictions:** While these calculators can graph and perform advanced scientific and statistical functions, they must NOT have any programmable features, equation solvers that store user-defined formulas, or text storage capabilities. No communication capabilities.

## Calculator Class III
- **Definition:** Any stand-alone programmable, non-graphing calculator that has the ability to store formulas or text.
- **Examples:** HP 35s.
- **Restrictions:** These calculators have programming capabilities and/or can store user-defined formulas or text. They must NOT have graphing capabilities or communication capabilities.

## Calculator Class IV
- **Definition:** Any stand-alone programmable, graphing calculator that has the ability to store formulas or text. This is the most permissive class.
- **Examples:** TI-89 Titanium, HP Prime, Casio fx-CG50.
- **Restrictions:** While these calculators are highly capable, they must be stand-alone devices. No devices capable of external communication (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) are permitted. No laptop computers, tablet computers, cell phones, or other multi-purpose communication devices may be used as calculators.

## General Rules for All Classes
- All calculators must be battery-operated and self-contained. No external power sources (other than batteries) are allowed.
- Any calculator that has a QWERTY keypad resembling a computer keyboard is generally prohibited, regardless of its class.
- Event supervisors have the final say on the legality of any calculator. Participants are encouraged to bring a backup calculator that is clearly Class I or II if there is any doubt about their primary calculator.
- Sharing of calculators between teams or participants is strictly prohibited.
- Participants are responsible for clearing any stored programs or information from programmable calculators before the event, if required by the event supervisor. Failure to do so may result in disqualification.
