# Materials Science C

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

1. DESCRIPTION: Teams will complete lab activities and answer a series of questions related to the materials science of nanomaterials with an emphasis on chemical, physical, optical, and mechanical properties of nanomaterials.

A TEAM OF UP TO: 2			APPROXIMATE TIME: 50 minutes
EYE PROTECTION: C			CALCULATOR: Class III

2. EVENT PARAMETERS:
a. Each participant may bring one 8.5” x 11” sheet of paper, which may be in a sheet protector sealed by tape or laminated, that may contain information on both sides in any form and from any source without any affixed labels.
b. Each participant must bring a writing implement and may bring a class III calculator.
c. Teams should bring any or all of the items listed on the Division C Chemistry Events Lab Equipment List, posted on soinc.org. Teams not bringing these items will be at a disadvantage, as they are not provided.
d. Participants must wear goggles, an apron or a lab coat and have skin covered from the neck down to the wrist and toes. Gloves are optional, but if the host requires a specific type they will notify teams. Pants should be loose fitting; if the host has more specific guidelines, they will notify teams in advance of the tournament. Shoulder length or longer hair must be tied back. Participants removing safety clothing/ goggles or unsafely handling materials, or equipment will be penalized or disqualified.
e. Supervisors will provide any required reagents, additional glassware, and/or references that are needed for the tasks (e.g., Periodic Table, table of standard reduction potentials, any constants needed).
