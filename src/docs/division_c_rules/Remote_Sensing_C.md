# Remote Sensing C - Climate Change

See General Rules, Eye Protection & other Policies on www.soinc.org as they apply to every event.

1. DESCRIPTION: Participants will use remote sensing imagery, data, and computational process skills to complete tasks related to climate change processes in the Earth system.

A TEAM OF UP TO: 2
APPROXIMATE TIME: 50 minutes
			
CALCULATOR: Class II

2. EVENT PARAMETERS:
a. Each team may bring one three-ring binder of any size containing information in any form and from any source attached using the available rings. Sheet protectors, lamination, tabs and labels are permitted. If the event features a rotation through a series of laboratory stations where the participants interact with samples, specimens, or displays; no material may be removed from the binder throughout the event.
b. Each team may bring two protractors, two rulers, and two Class II calculators.

3. THE COMPETITION:
a. The event will consist of questions and activities testing concepts related to the collection and use of remote sensing data to observe and study climate change processes and their effects on Earth systems.
b. The test should be divided so that approximately 25% focuses on topics under 3.c., 35% focuses on topics under 3.d., 20% focuses on topics under 3.e., and 20% focuses on topics under 3.f. Students should not be expected to know or use calculus to answer any questions.
c. Remote sensing instrumentation and physics.
i. Active vs. Passive sensors
ii. Optical and infrared imagers, radiometers, LIDAR, space-based gravimetry
iii. Radar Altimetry, precipitation radar, Doppler radar (ground, airborne, and satellite-based)
iv. Reflection, refraction, attenuation, transmission, and scattering of light by the atmosphere, aerosols, water, vegetation
v. Spectroscopy, including regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, basic types of spectra (continuous, emission, and absorption), usage in identifying composition (atmospheric gases, etc.)
vi. Characteristics of blackbody radiation (Wien’s Law, Stefan-Boltzmann Law, Rayleigh-Jeans Law)
vii. Orbital properties, including Kepler’s Laws, types of orbits (LEO, MEO, HEO, geosynchronous, geostationary, polar, sun-synchronous)
viii. Imaging fidelity/quality, including satellite altitude or semi-major axis and angular resolution, instantaneous field of view, ground sample distance, field of view; revisit period vs. orbital period vs. framerate to cover a swath
d. Interpretation of images and datasets from only the listed satellites and instruments, as relevant to the topics of this event. Appropriate context (e.g. sensors, bands, etc.) should be provided as necessary for satellite imagery.
i. Optical, infrared, and Doppler radar imagery of clouds, precipitation, and extreme weather events (MODIS on Aqua, CALIPSO, CloudSat, GOES, Suomi NPP, GPM)
ii. Sea level rise and surface waves (PACE, JASON, GRACE)
iii. Distributions and radiative effects of greenhouse gases, trace atmospheric gases, and aerosols (OCO2, Aura, MODIS on Aqua, GOES, Suomi NPP, CALIPSO, PACE)
iv. Atmospheric and sea surface temperatures (MODIS on Aqua, ECOSTRESS, ATMS, GOES, CrIS on Suomi NPP)
v. Radiative energy flux (CERES on Suomi NPP, PACE)
e. Climate processes.
i. Atmospheric concentrations and distributions of greenhouse gases, trace gases, and aerosols (CO2, H2O, CH4, N2O, SO2, Ozone, CFCs, HFCs, NH3, Halogenated gas), and relevant influencing factors (e.g. solar activity, volcanic activity, Earth’s orbit and seasons, atmospheric and ocean circulation)
ii. El Niño-Southern Oscillation and its effects on regional climate
iii. Carbon cycle and Nitrogen cycle, the impacts of natural phenomena and anthropogenic activity on these cycles, and relevance of these cycles to climate processes
iv. The effects of climate change on existing weather processes (e.g. clouds and rainfall, flooding, sea level rise, heat waves, atmospheric effects of wildfires)
v. Ecological impacts, such as on vegetation and biome distributions
f. Energy balance modeling and climate change.
i. The effects of atmospheric and surface conditions (e.g. clouds, aerosols, surface albedo) on climate change, including radiative forcing and climate feedback loops
ii. Blackbody radiation (using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law) absorbed by the Earth from the Sun, and emitted from the Earth.
iii. Albedo-based reflection by surface, ice, and clouds
iv. Modeling planetary equilibrium temperature as a result of the interaction between incoming and outgoing radiation, and changes to equilibrium temperature due to atmospheric and surface conditions
v. Changes in heating and cooling rates over time using linear, piecewise-linear, and exponential functions
