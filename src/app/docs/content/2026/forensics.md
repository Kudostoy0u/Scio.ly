## Overview
Forensic analysis of unknowns and trace evidence with reasoning and report writing.

## Core Topics
- Qualitative analysis; chromatography  
- Microscopy: fibers/hairs/polymers  
- Fingerprints; simple metal analysis  
- Scenario synthesis and conclusions

## Qualitative analysis details
- Powders: solubility, pH, reaction with vinegar/iodine; crystalline shape under magnifier
- Liquids: pH, miscibility, odor (only if safe/allowed), reactions with known reagents
- Polymers: burn/odor/ash tests (only if allowed), density floats, microscope textures

## Chromatography
- Set up consistent solvent front; measure Rf = distance solute / distance solvent front; compare patterns across inks/dyes

## Microscopy
- Fibers: natural (twist, irregular) vs synthetic (uniform); weave types; burning behavior (if allowed)
- Hair: medullary index, scale pattern (as scope allows)

## Reporting
- Use clear tables for observations; justify IDs with ≥2 consistent traits; note uncertainties

## Safety
- Wear goggles; handle acids/bases and burners per rules; label waste and dispose properly
