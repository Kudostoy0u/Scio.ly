## Overview
Experimental Design rewards process. You earn points by defining a clear, testable question, writing operational definitions for variables, designing a fair test with enough trials, organizing data so trends are obvious, and concluding with concise, data‑anchored statements and realistic improvements. Think like a scientist under time: plan, execute, and communicate.

## Building a fair test
Start by articulating the hypothesis as a directional relationship between the independent and dependent variables and state a mechanism in a single sentence. Define levels for the independent variable that are far enough apart to reveal a trend, and hold constants steady with simple, enforceable procedures. Use at least three trials per level to average out noise and randomize order if carryover or learning effects are plausible. Before you touch materials, sketch the apparatus and draft a numbered procedure that someone else could follow—then leave space in your report to record deviations, because real experiments rarely go exactly to plan.

## Data organization and analysis
Well‑designed tables, with units and spaces for raw and processed values, save time later. Choose graphs that match the data: line plots for continuous variables across ordered levels and bar charts for categorical comparisons. Label axes with units, title the plot with IV→DV language, and, if allowed, include basic statistics such as mean and range or standard deviation. In analysis, describe trends (increase, decrease, non‑linear), note outliers with plausible causes, and distinguish systematic from random error. When possible, connect results back to the hypothesized mechanism so your conclusion is more than a restatement of a slope.

## Rubric spine (typical elements)
- Statement of Problem/Hypothesis: testable, includes IV/DV, uses operational language
- Variables and Operational Definitions: IV levels, DV with units, constants, and control if applicable
- Experimental Design: materials list and step‑by‑step procedure; repeated trials (≥3); randomization/ordering where relevant
- Data Collection and Organization: labeled tables with units; spaces for raw and processed data; dates/times; uncertainties if applicable
- Graphs and Statistics: appropriate graph type with labeled axes; calculations (mean, range; SD if allowed)
- Analysis and Interpretation: trends, relationships, error sources (systematic vs random), and limitations
- Conclusion: accept/reject hypothesis with specific data and propose concrete improvements or next steps

## Common fixes for common pitfalls
Ambiguity vanishes when variables are operationally defined with units and ranges. Insufficient trials are solved by planning levels and repetitions before timing starts. Missing controls are addressed by dedicating one baseline level where the independent variable is absent or neutral. Unclear graphs improve the moment you label axes with units and pick a plot type that matches the variable types.

## Worked prompt (example)
Materials: cups, baking soda, vinegar, thermometer, stopwatches, scale. Question: How does vinegar concentration affect peak temperature change in a fixed‑mass reaction with baking soda? Plan: vary percent vinegar (5%, 20%, 35% by volume) at constant total volume and baking soda mass; measure ΔT peak with three trials per level. Organize data into a table with initial temperature, peak temperature, ΔT, and trial notes, then graph ΔT versus concentration. In analysis, discuss confounders such as heat losses and mixing rate and propose improvements like insulation and thermometer calibration.

## Practice prompts (timed)
- Given a materials list, design an experiment to test a specified IV→DV and produce a complete report structure in 20 minutes.
- Convert a set of raw measurements into a clear table and graph, then write a six‑sentence analysis including two specific improvements.
