# Experimental Design (2026)

Divisions: B, C  
Type: Lab/Inquiry  
Participants: 2–3  
Approx. Time: 50 minutes  
Allowed Materials: Usually no external notes; materials provided; confirm rules

## Overview
Design and conduct an experiment from provided materials, analyze data, and write a structured lab report under time constraints.

## Core Topics
- Variables: IV/DV/constants; hypothesis  
- Procedure design: control/replication  
- Data tables/graphs; analysis and error  
- Conclusion and future improvements

## Strategy
- Use a consistent report template  
- Practice with random material sets  
- Time management: allocate build, run, and write blocks

## Complete rubric breakdown (typical)
- Statement of Problem/Hypothesis: testable, includes IV/DV, operational language
- Variables and Operational Definitions: IV levels, DV units, constants controlled; clear definitions
- Experimental Design: materials list, repeated trials (≥3), detailed step-by-step procedure referencing controls and randomization when relevant
- Data Collection and Organization: labeled tables with units, space for raw and processed data, dates/times, uncertainties if applicable
- Graphs and Statistics: appropriate graph type, axes with units, title, legend; calculations (mean, range, percent error); optional basic stats (SD) if allowed

Rubric pitfalls to avoid
- Hypothesis not directly testable or not tied to IV/DV  
- Missing constants/control; unclear operational definitions  
- No repeated trials or insufficient levels for IV  
- Data tables missing units/labels; graphs without error depiction (if allowed)
- Analysis and Interpretation: trends, relationships, outliers, sources of error (systematic vs random), limitations
- Conclusion: restate hypothesis outcome; support with specific data; propose improvements and future work

## Report template (fill-in)
- Title: [Effect of IV on DV]
- Purpose/Hypothesis: If [IV] is [increased/decreased], then [DV] will [increase/decrease/remain] because [mechanism].
- Variables: IV = … (levels …); DV = … (units …); Constants = …; Control group = …
- Materials: list with sizes/quantities
- Procedure: numbered steps; include control and randomization; specify trials (n≥3) and timing
- Data: table(s) with units; sample calculation; graph with labeled axes and title
- Analysis: trend description; error sources and impact; unexpected observations
- Conclusion: accept/reject hypothesis with data; improvements and next steps

## Quick statistics (as allowed)
- Mean: x̄ = Σx/n; Range = max−min; Percent error = |measured−true|/true ×100%
- If SD permitted: s = √(Σ(x−x̄)²/(n−1)); Use error bars consistently

## Common pitfalls and fixes
- Vague variables → write operational definitions with specific units/ranges
- Insufficient trials → plan ≥3 per level; stagger timing to manage clock
- Missing control → designate and treat as baseline in analysis
- Unclear graphs → label units; choose correct plot (bar for categories, line for continuous)

## Worked prompt (example)
Materials: cups, baking soda, vinegar, thermometer, stopwatches, scale.  
Question: How does vinegar concentration affect peak temperature change in a fixed-mass reaction with baking soda?  
Plan: Vary percent vinegar (5%, 20%, 35% by volume) at constant total volume and baking soda mass; measure ΔT peak; 3 trials per level.  
Data: Prepare a table with initial T, peak T, ΔT, trial notes. Graph ΔT vs concentration; discuss confounders (heat losses, mixing rate) and improvements (insulation, calibration).

## Practice prompts (timed)
- Given materials [list], design an experiment to test [IV→DV]; produce full report structure in 20 minutes
- Convert raw data to a clear table and graph; write a 4–6 sentence analysis with two concrete improvements
