Divisions: B, C  
Type: Study (ID)  
Participants: 2–3  
Approx. Time: 50 minutes  
Allowed Materials: Field guide/binder (confirm)

## Overview
Identification and classification of minerals and rocks; properties, formation processes, uses, and environmental aspects. Emphasis on rapid ID with justification, process reasoning, and applied geology.

## Core Topics (coverage target)
- Minerals: hardness (Mohs), luster (metallic/non-metallic types), color vs streak, cleavage vs fracture, habit, specific gravity, crystal systems (qualitative)
- Mineral groups: silicates (framework/sheet/chain/isolated), carbonates, oxides, sulfides, halides, phosphates, native elements
- Igneous rocks: texture (phaneritic/aphanitic/porphyritic/glassy/vesicular), composition (felsic–mafic); intrusive vs extrusive; Bowen’s series (qualitative)
- Sedimentary rocks: clastic (grain size, sorting, rounding), biochemical, chemical; structures (bedding, cross-beds, ripples)
- Metamorphic rocks: foliated vs non-foliated; index minerals; protolith relationships; facies (conceptual)
- Processes: weathering, transport, deposition, diagenesis, metamorphism; tectonic settings
- Economic/environmental: ore minerals, industrial uses, hazards, and sustainability

## Skills
- Rapid ID from samples/photos with ≥2 diagnostic traits  
- Link properties to formation conditions and tectonic context  
- Justify ambiguous calls and note uncertainties

## In-depth guide

Mineral identification begins with luster: metallic specimens reflect like metal; non‑metallic lusters include vitreous (glassy), pearly, silky, resinous, and earthy. Hardness, measured on Mohs scale, quickly narrows candidates: a steel nail (~5.5) scratches apatite but not feldspars; quartz (7) scratches glass; talc (1) is easily marked. Streak—powder color on unglazed porcelain—reveals true pigment and is often more reliable than bulk color (hematite streaks reddish even when black). Cleavage describes planes of weakness; count directions (e.g., calcite three at rhombohedral angles, halite three at 90°) and distinguish from fracture (conchoidal in quartz). Specific gravity provides heft clues (galena notably dense). When safe and permitted, simple chemical tests (dilute HCl fizz for carbonates) and magnetism (magnetite) add confidence.

Igneous rocks record melt history. Texture reflects cooling rate: phaneritic (slow, intrusive), aphanitic (fast, extrusive), porphyritic (two‑stage), glassy (quenched), vesicular (gas escape). Composition trends from felsic (light, Si‑/K‑rich: granite/rhyolite) to mafic (dark, Mg‑/Fe‑rich: gabbro/basalt) according to Bowen’s reaction series; cumulate textures and zoning record fractionation. Tectonic setting imprints chemistry (ophiolites with ultramafics, island arcs with andesites, MORB basalts at ridges). Sedimentary rocks archive Earth’s surface: clastic grain size/rounding/sorting reflect transport energy and distance; chemical (evaporites) and biochemical (limestones, coal) indicate depositional environments. Structures (cross‑bedding, ripple marks, graded bedding, mud cracks) reveal paleoflow and subaerial exposure. Metamorphic rocks form under pressure–temperature regimes; foliated textures (slate→phyllite→schist→gneiss) track increasing grade, while non‑foliated marbles and quartzites reflect parent lithology; index minerals (chlorite, garnet, staurolite, kyanite, sillimanite) indicate conditions.

Economic and environmental geology integrates properties and processes: sulfide ores conduct and weather to colorful secondary minerals; lateritic bauxites form in intense weathering; REE deposits associate with carbonatites and pegmatites. Environmental considerations include acid mine drainage from pyrite oxidation and remediation using neutralization and constructed wetlands. In competitions, justify answers by tying diagnostic properties directly to process: “two cleavages at ~90°, striations, hardness ~6 → plagioclase; sandstone well‑sorted and rounded → eolian dune origin.”
## Worked examples
1) Mineral: vitreous non-metallic luster, H≈7, no cleavage, conchoidal fracture, color variable, streak white → Quartz
2) Igneous: fine-grained mafic, vesicles → Scoria/Basalt variant; likely extrusive, rapid degassing
3) Sedimentary: clastic, sand-sized, quartz-rich, well-sorted/rounded → Quartz sandstone; beach/dune provenance
4) Metamorphic: foliated, coarse mica alignment → Schist; protolith likely shale; medium–high grade

## Quick ID tables (reminders)
- Carbonates fizz with dilute HCl (calcite strong; dolomite powdered)
- Feldspars: two cleavages ~90°; K-feldspar often pink, plagioclase shows striations
- Mica: perfect basal cleavage (biotite dark, muscovite light)
- Halite: salty taste (do not taste in lab competitions unless explicitly allowed); cubic cleavage

## Pitfalls
- Overreliance on color; ignoring streak and hardness  
- Confusing cleavage planes with parting or crystal faces  
- Misreading foliation vs compositional banding in gneiss

## Practice prompts
- Identify 10 mixed specimens and justify each with two properties  
- Explain how texture indicates cooling rate or metamorphic grade
