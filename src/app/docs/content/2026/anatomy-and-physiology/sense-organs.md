## Overview
Special senses transduce physical/chemical stimuli to neural signals: light (vision), sound/head motion (hearing/balance), and tastants/odorants (gustation/olfaction).

## Vision
- Optics: cornea (major refraction), lens (accommodation), pupil/iris (light control), retina (photoreceptors → bipolar → ganglion cells). Fovea for high acuity.
- Phototransduction: in darkness, cGMP‑gated Na⁺/Ca²⁺ channels open; light → rhodopsin activation → transducin → PDE → ↓cGMP → channel closure → hyperpolarization; graded release onto bipolar cells.
- Adaptation: rods for scotopic, cones for photopic color vision; bleaching and regeneration dynamics.
- Pathways: optic nerve → chiasm (nasal fibers cross) → tract → LGN → visual cortex; homonymous defects map to lesions.

## Hearing
- Outer/middle/inner ear: tympanic membrane, ossicles (impedance matching), oval window, cochlea.
- Transduction: basilar membrane tonotopy; hair cell stereocilia deflection opens mechanically gated K⁺ channels (endolymph high K⁺) → depolarization → neurotransmitter release onto auditory nerve.
- Sound encoding: place coding by frequency; intensity by firing rate/population; temporal coding at low frequencies.

## Vestibular
- Semicircular canals (angular acceleration); otolith organs (utricle/saccule for linear acceleration/tilt). Cupula/inertia principles.

## Taste and smell
- Taste: receptors for sweet, bitter, umami (GPCR), salty/sour (ion channels); cranial nerves VII, IX, X to nucleus tractus solitarius.
- Olfaction: odorant → GPCR on olfactory neurons → cAMP → cation influx; strong adaptation; direct projection to olfactory bulb/cortex (limbic links).

## Worked micro‑examples
1) Visual field defect
- Left homonymous hemianopia suggests right optic tract/optic radiation/occipital lesion; macular sparing implies PCA with MCA collateral.

2) Audiogram reasoning
- High‑frequency hearing loss begins at base (stiff) of cochlea; noise‑induced notch at 4 kHz common.

3) Vestibular test
- Head impulse abnormal to left suggests left horizontal canal hypofunction; nystagmus direction helps lateralize.

## Pitfalls
- Confusing phototransduction sign (light hyperpolarizes rods/cones).
- Misattributing which taste modalities use GPCRs vs channels.
- Ignoring decussation at optic chiasm when localizing field cuts.

## Practice prompts
- Trace visual pathways and predict field defects for specific lesions.
- Explain cochlear tonotopy and effects of selective hair cell damage.
- Compare semicircular canal vs otolith responses to motion.
