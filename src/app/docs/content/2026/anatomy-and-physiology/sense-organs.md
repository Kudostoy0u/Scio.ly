## Overview
Vision, hearing, equilibrium, taste, and smell; transduction and pathways.

## High-Yield Topics
- Eye: layers; lens; retina (rods/cones); accommodation; phototransduction
- Ear: outer/middle/inner; cochlea; hair cells; vestibular apparatus
- Taste/smell: receptors; basic pathways; adaptation
- Common disorders overview

## Study Roadmap
1) Diagram eye/ear with key structures and functions
2) Trace phototransduction and auditory transduction steps
3) Lesion localization basics for pathways
