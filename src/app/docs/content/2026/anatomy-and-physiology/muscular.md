## Overview
Muscle tissue types and physiology of contraction; roles in movement and posture.

## High-Yield Topics
- Types: skeletal, cardiac, smooth; structural/functional differences
- Sarcomere: actin, myosin, troponin/tropomyosin; bands/zones
- EC coupling: motor neuron → ACh → depolarization → Ca²⁺ release
- Cross-bridge cycle and ATP roles; rigor mortis
- Fiber types: Type I/II; fatigue and energy systems
- NMJ disorders; myopathies overview

## Study Roadmap
1) Draw sarcomere and label band changes with contraction
2) Sequence EC coupling and cross-bridge steps
3) Compare fiber type properties and use cases
