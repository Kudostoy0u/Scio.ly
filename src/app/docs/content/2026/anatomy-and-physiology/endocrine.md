## Overview
Endocrinology examines hormone synthesis, secretion, transport, receptor signaling, and feedback across major axes. Exam questions favor axis diagrams, lab pattern interpretation, and receptor mechanisms.

## Hormone classes and receptors
- Peptide/amine hormones: membrane receptors (GPCR/RTK); fast signaling via second messengers (cAMP, IP₃/DAG, Ca²⁺).
- Steroid/thyroid hormones: intracellular/nuclear receptors; transcriptional modulation; slower onset, longer duration; require carriers in blood.

## Hypothalamic–pituitary axes (survey)
- HPT: TRH → TSH → T₄/T₃; negative feedback on pituitary/hypothalamus.
- HPA: CRH → ACTH → cortisol; diurnal rhythm, stress response; feedback suppresses CRH/ACTH.
- HPG: GnRH (pulsatile) → LH/FSH → sex steroids (testosterone, estrogen/progesterone); feedback with sex‑specific nuances.
- Posterior pituitary: ADH (V₂ renal water reabsorption; V₁ vasoconstriction) and oxytocin (milk let‑down, uterine contraction) released from hypothalamic neurons.

## Thyroid and calcium homeostasis
- Thyroid: iodide uptake, thyroglobulin iodination, TPO activity, T₄→T₃ conversion peripherally.
- Calcium–phosphate: PTH increases serum Ca²⁺ (bone resorption, kidney reabsorption, ↑1,25‑(OH)₂‑D synthesis); calcitonin opposes resorption; vitamin D increases Ca/PO₄ absorption.

## Pancreas and metabolism (survey)
- Insulin (β cells): promotes glucose uptake (GLUT4 translocation), glycogen/lipid synthesis, protein synthesis; lowers blood glucose.
- Glucagon (α cells): raises blood glucose via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis; lipolysis.

## Lab patterns (qualitative recognition)
- Primary vs secondary/tertiary: primary target gland failure → hormone low with tropic high (e.g., primary hypothyroid: low T₄/T₃, high TSH); secondary (pituitary) or tertiary (hypothalamus) deficiencies → low both.
- Hyperfunction: e.g., Cushing patterns (ACTH‑dependent vs independent) at concept level; Graves (TSI stimulating TSH receptor) vs toxic nodules.

## Worked micro‑examples
1) Axis defect
- Low free T₄ with high TSH → primary hypothyroidism; symptoms (fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance) discussed qualitatively.

2) Receptor mechanism
- Epinephrine binding β‑adrenergic GPCR → ↑cAMP → PKA activation → glycogen phosphorylase activation → ↑glucose release.

3) Ca²⁺ homeostasis
- Low dietary Ca²⁺ elevates PTH → ↑1,25‑(OH)₂‑D; increases intestinal absorption and renal reabsorption; prolonged elevation increases bone resorption.

## Pitfalls
- Confusing hormone class with receptor location and signaling speed.
- Misreading primary vs secondary lab patterns; forgetting negative feedback logic.
- Ignoring binding proteins’ effect on total vs free hormone levels.

## Practice prompts
- Draw the HPA axis and predict cortisol/ACTH changes after exogenous glucocorticoids.
- Explain why TSH can be low‑normal in central hypothyroidism despite low T₄.
- Describe insulin vs glucagon effects on liver, muscle, and adipose tissues.
