# Anatomy – Immune (2026)

## Overview
Innate and adaptive immunity components and mechanisms.

## High-Yield Topics
- Innate: barriers, complement, phagocytes, NK cells, inflammation
- Adaptive: B/T cells, clonal selection, antibody classes/functions
- Antigen presentation; MHC I vs II, CD8 vs CD4
- Hypersensitivity overview; vaccination principles

## Study Roadmap
1) Flowchart innate→adaptive response
2) Antibody classes table
3) Antigen presentation pathways
