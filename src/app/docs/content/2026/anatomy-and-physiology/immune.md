## Overview
Immunology distinguishes rapid innate defenses from specific, memory‑forming adaptive responses. Key tools include complement pathways, antigen presentation, and antibody effector functions.

## Innate immunity
- Barriers: skin, mucosa, cilia, acid, antimicrobial peptides.
- Cells: neutrophils (phagocytosis), macrophages (phagocytosis/antigen presentation), dendritic cells (professional APCs), NK cells (missing‑self recognition), mast cells/eosinophils (allergy/parasites).
- Complement (survey): classical (Ab‑mediated), lectin (MBL), alternative (spontaneous) pathways converge on C3 convertase → opsonization (C3b), inflammation (C3a/C5a), MAC (C5b‑C9).
- Inflammation: PRRs (TLRs) detect PAMPs/DAMPs → cytokines (IL‑1, TNF‑α) → vascular changes, leukocyte recruitment.

## Adaptive immunity
- B cells: clonal selection; somatic hypermutation and class switching (T‑dependent); plasma/memory cells.
- T cells: TCR recognizes peptide‑MHC; CD4 (MHC II) helper subsets (Th1/Th2/Th17/Tfh) vs CD8 (MHC I) cytotoxic.
- Antigen presentation: endogenous peptides via MHC I (proteasome/TAP) vs exogenous via MHC II (endosomal); cross‑presentation exceptions.
- Antibody classes: IgM (primary), IgG (opsonization, placenta), IgA (mucosal), IgE (allergy/parasites), IgD (BCR role). Functions: neutralization, opsonization, complement activation, ADCC.

## Hypersensitivity (survey)
- Type I (immediate, IgE/mast): anaphylaxis, allergies.
- Type II (antibody‑mediated cytotoxicity): hemolysis (ABO mismatch), Goodpasture.
- Type III (immune complex): serum sickness, some glomerulonephritides.
- Type IV (delayed, T‑cell): contact dermatitis, TB skin test.

## Vaccination principles
- Active immunity via antigen exposure; adjuvants enhance innate signals; herd effects depend on R₀ and coverage.

## Worked micro‑examples
1) Complement deficiency
- C5–C9 deficiency → recurrent Neisseria infections (MAC defect); properdin deficiency affects alternative pathway.

2) MHC restriction
- A CD8 T cell specific to peptide X on HLA‑A*02:01 will not recognize X on a different HLA allele (restriction).

3) Hypersensitivity classification
- Urticaria minutes after peanut ingestion → Type I; rash 48 h after nickel exposure → Type IV.

## Pitfalls
- Confusing MHC I vs II pathways and which T cell recognizes each.
- Ignoring antibody class functions in mucosal vs systemic compartments.
- Overlooking innate–adaptive crosstalk (e.g., cytokines shaping Th subsets).

## Practice prompts
- Trace antigen processing for a viral vs bacterial extracellular protein.
- Match antibody classes to functions and anatomical sites.
- Classify clinical vignettes by hypersensitivity type.
