## Overview
Neuroanatomy and neurophysiology integrate cellular excitability with systems‑level organization. Common question styles include action potential mechanics, synaptic integration, tract/lobe functions, and autonomics.

## Cellular neurophysiology
- Resting potential: set by ion gradients (Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase, K⁺ leak); Goldman/Hodgkin–Katz conceptually.
- Action potential: threshold → rapid Na⁺ influx (depolarization) → Na⁺ inactivation + K⁺ efflux (repolarization) → after‑hyperpolarization; absolute vs relative refractory periods.
- Conduction: myelination enables saltatory conduction at nodes of Ranvier; velocity increases with axon diameter and myelin thickness.

## Synapses and transmitters
- Chemical synapses: presynaptic Ca²⁺ influx → vesicle fusion → neurotransmitter release; postsynaptic receptors (ionotropic vs metabotropic) generate EPSPs/IPSPs.
- Major transmitters (scope): glutamate (excitatory), GABA (inhibitory), acetylcholine (neuromuscular junction, autonomics), monoamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin) with modulatory roles.
- Summation: temporal and spatial integration at axon hillock; inhibitory shunting reduces EPSP effectiveness.

## Neuroanatomy
- CNS regions: cerebrum (lobes), diencephalon (thalamus/hypothalamus), brainstem (midbrain/pons/medulla), cerebellum, spinal cord.
- Lobes and functions: frontal (motor, executive), parietal (somatosensory, spatial), temporal (auditory, memory), occipital (vision). Broca (expressive) vs Wernicke (receptive) language areas.
- Tracts: corticospinal (motor), dorsal column–medial lemniscus (fine touch/proprioception), spinothalamic (pain/temperature). Decussation points are test favorites.

## Reflexes and autonomic system
- Reflex arc: receptor → afferent → integration → efferent → effector; stretch reflex (monosynaptic) vs withdrawal (polysynaptic).
- Autonomic: sympathetic (thoracolumbar; fight‑or‑flight) vs parasympathetic (craniosacral; rest‑and‑digest); receptor pharmacology (nicotinic vs muscarinic; adrenergic α/β) at survey depth.

## Worked micro‑examples
1) Lesion localization
- Loss of pain/temp on contralateral body with ipsilateral facial deficits suggests brainstem lesion; dorsal column loss ipsilateral below lesion suggests spinal cord hemisection.

2) Synaptic integration
- Two subthreshold EPSPs summate temporally to reach threshold; concurrent IPSP near soma can prevent spiking (shunting inhibition).

3) Conduction velocity
- Demyelination reduces membrane resistance, increasing capacitance per unit length → slowed conduction and conduction block in long fibers.

## Pitfalls
- Confusing sensory tract decussation locations; mixing Broca vs Wernicke aphasia features.
- Assuming all inhibitory synapses are GABAergic in the periphery (glycine in spinal cord also inhibitory).
- Ignoring passive cable properties when reasoning about synaptic integration.

## Practice prompts
- Trace dorsal column vs spinothalamic pathways and mark decussation sites.
- Predict effects of a left MCA stroke on language and motor/sensory deficits.
- Explain how myelination changes conduction speed and metabolic cost.
