## Overview
Bones, joints, and cartilage form a dynamic system for support, protection, movement, mineral homeostasis, and hematopoiesis.

## Macroscopic anatomy
- Classification: long (femur), short (carpals), flat (sternum), irregular (vertebrae), sesamoid (patella).
- Long bone structure: diaphysis, metaphysis, epiphysis, epiphyseal plate/line, periosteum, endosteum, medullary cavity.
- Joint types: fibrous (suture, syndesmosis), cartilaginous (synchondrosis, symphysis), synovial (plane, hinge, pivot, condylar, saddle, ball‑and‑socket).

## Microscopic anatomy
- Compact bone: osteons (concentric lamellae), central (Haversian) canals, perforating (Volkmann) canals; osteocytes in lacunae connected via canaliculi.
- Spongy bone: trabeculae aligned with stress lines; houses marrow and reduces mass.
- Cartilage: hyaline (articular), fibrocartilage (menisci, intervertebral discs), elastic (epiglottis); avascular nutrition via diffusion.

## Cells and remodeling
- Osteoblasts: bone formation; secrete osteoid (type I collagen + ground substance), initiate mineralization.
- Osteoclasts: multinucleated, resorb bone via acidification and proteases; RANKL/OPG system regulates activation.
- Osteocytes: mechanosensors; regulate remodeling via sclerostin and canalicular fluid flow.
- Remodeling balance: coupled resorption–formation maintains strength; Wolff’s law adapts architecture to load.

## Ossification and growth
- Intramembranous: mesenchyme → osteoblasts (flat bones of skull, mandible, clavicle parts).
- Endochondral: cartilage model → hypertrophy → calcification → vascular invasion → primary/secondary ossification centers; growth plate zones (reserve, proliferative, hypertrophic, calcified, ossification).
- Growth plate closure: estrogen/testosterone accelerate maturation; fractures through plates (Salter–Harris classification) impact growth.

## Biomechanics and mineral homeostasis
- Stress/strain: cortical vs trabecular behavior; anisotropy along long axes.
- Mineral reservoir: PTH increases osteoclast activity indirectly (via osteoblast RANKL), raising serum Ca²⁺; calcitonin counteracts in select contexts; vitamin D enhances intestinal Ca/PO₄ absorption.

## Fracture healing
- Stages: hematoma → soft callus (fibrocartilage) → hard callus (woven bone) → remodeling (lamellar bone). Adequate perfusion, immobilization, and proper reduction are key.
- Complications: malunion, nonunion, avascular necrosis (e.g., femoral head), infection (open fractures).

## Pathology highlights
- Osteoporosis: low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration; vertebral compression fractures; risk factors (age, sex hormones, glucocorticoids, immobility).
- Osteomalacia/rickets: defective mineralization (vitamin D deficiency/CKD); bone pain, deformities.
- Osteogenesis imperfecta: collagen Type I defect; brittle bones, blue sclerae (clinical correlates; qualitative scope).

## Worked micro‑examples
1) Growth plate lesion
- A 12‑year‑old with physeal fracture near the distal radius: describe zones traversed and predict growth disturbance risk (higher if across proliferative/hypertrophic zones).

2) Load alignment
- Explain why trabeculae in the femoral neck align along principal compressive/tensile lines; relate to fracture patterns in osteoporosis.

3) Calcium regulation scenario
- Low dietary Ca²⁺ → ↑PTH → ↑osteoclast activity and renal Ca²⁺ reabsorption; long‑term risk for bone loss without vitamin D/calcium correction.

## Pitfalls
- Confusing cartilage types at joints (articular cartilage is hyaline, not fibrocartilage).
- Mixing osteoblast vs osteoclast roles; forgetting osteocytes’ mechanosensory function.
- Overlooking periosteum/endosteum roles in appositional growth and remodeling.

## Practice prompts
- Label an osteon and trace nutrient diffusion path to an osteocyte.
- Order endochondral ossification zones from epiphysis to diaphysis and list cellular events.
- Compare compact vs spongy bone functions and mechanical behavior.
