## Overview
Bones, joints, cartilage; functions: support, protection, movement, storage, hematopoiesis.

## High-Yield Topics
- Classification: long/short/flat/irregular/sesamoid
- Microscopic: osteon, Haversian/Volkmann canals, osteocytes in lacunae, canaliculi
- Cells: osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes; remodeling
- Ossification: intramembranous vs endochondral; growth plates
- Joints: fibrous, cartilaginous, synovial; movements and examples
- Common disorders: osteoporosis, fracture healing stages

## Study Roadmap
1) Label diagrams (long bone, osteon, synovial joint)
2) Memorize ossification and remodeling steps
3) Case vignettes: fractures, osteoporosis risk factors
