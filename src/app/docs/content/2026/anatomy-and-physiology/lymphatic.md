## Overview
The lymphatic system returns interstitial fluid to blood, absorbs lipids (lacteals), and provides immune surveillance. Master drainage pathways and organ functions.

## Vessels and flow
- Blind‑ended capillaries with flap‑like minivalves; flow aided by skeletal muscle, valves, and pressure gradients; obstruction causes lymphedema.

## Organs
- Primary: bone marrow (B‑cell development), thymus (T‑cell maturation; cortex/medulla; Hassall corpuscles).
- Secondary: lymph nodes (cortex follicles with B cells; paracortex T cells; medulla cords/sinuses), spleen (white pulp immune, red pulp filter/ RBC clearance), MALT (tonsils, Peyer patches, appendix).

## Drainage (survey)
- Right lymphatic duct drains right upper quadrant; thoracic duct drains rest into left subclavian vein; cisterna chyli origin.

## Immune interface
- Antigen capture in tissues → afferent lymphatics → node; dendritic cells present antigen to naïve T cells; germinal centers support B‑cell maturation.

## Worked micro‑examples
1) Node architecture
- Enlarged, tender nodes with prominent germinal centers suggest active B‑cell response; painless, firm nodes may suggest alternative pathology (scope awareness only).

2) Post‑mastectomy lymphedema
- Disrupted axillary drainage → arm swelling; compression and lymphatic therapy as management concepts.

## Pitfalls
- Confusing drainage territories of thoracic vs right lymphatic ducts.
- Ignoring spleen dual roles (immune vs filtration) and vulnerability to encapsulated organisms after splenectomy (vaccination considerations).

## Practice prompts
- Map drainage from small intestine lacteals to venous angle.
- Label node microanatomy and cell populations.
- Explain thymic selection outcomes (positive/negative) conceptually.
