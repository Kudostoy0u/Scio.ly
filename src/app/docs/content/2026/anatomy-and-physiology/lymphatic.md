## Overview
Lymphatic drainage and immune system basics (innate/adaptive).

## High-Yield Topics
- Lymph vessels/nodes; spleen; thymus; tonsils
- Innate immunity: barriers, phagocytes, complement, inflammation
- Adaptive: B/T cells; clonal selection; antibodies; MHC I/II
- Vaccination principles; hypersensitivities overview

## Study Roadmap
1) Map drainage pathways and node clusters
2) Compare innate vs adaptive timelines and components
3) Antibody classes and functions summary
