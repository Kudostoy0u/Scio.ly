# Anatomy – Integumentary (2026)

## Overview
Skin layers and appendages; barriers, thermoregulation, and healing.

## High-Yield Topics
- Epidermis layers (CLGSB) and keratinocyte maturation
- Dermis (papillary/reticular); hypodermis
- Appendages: hair, nails, glands (eccrine/apocrine/sebaceous)
- Thermoregulation; vitamin D synthesis
- Wound healing phases; burns classification (rule of nines)
- Common disorders overview

## Study Roadmap
1) Label layers and structures on diagrams
2) Map gland types to secretions and functions
3) Practice burn scenarios and healing stages
