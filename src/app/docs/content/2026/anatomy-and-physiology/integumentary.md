## Overview
The integumentary system provides barrier, thermoregulation, sensation, and metabolic functions. Master topics include epidermal turnover, dermal structure, appendages, and wound healing.

## Layers and cells
- Epidermis (avascular): stratum basale (stem cells, melanocytes), spinosum (desmosomes), granulosum (keratohyalin), lucidum (thick skin), corneum (keratinized). Langerhans (APCs) in spinosum.
- Dermis: papillary (loose connective tissue, capillaries, Meissner corpuscles) and reticular (dense irregular CT, collagen/elastin, Pacinian corpuscles). Hypodermis: adipose, insulation.

## Pigmentation and UV
- Melanocytes produce melanin transferred to keratinocytes; eumelanin vs pheomelanin; tanning phases; photoprotection; vitamin D synthesis in keratinocytes (UVB‑dependent).

## Appendages
- Hair follicles, nails, glands: eccrine (thermoregulatory sweat), apocrine (scent), sebaceous (sebum). Distribution and control (sympathetic cholinergic for eccrine).

## Thermoregulation
- Vasodilation/vasoconstriction of dermal vessels; sweating; arrector pili (minor).

## Wound healing
- Phases: hemostasis → inflammation → proliferation (granulation tissue, re‑epithelialization) → remodeling (collagen maturation, tensile strength rises). Hypertrophic vs keloid scarring distinctions.

## Burns (survey)
- Degrees: superficial (epidermis), partial thickness (into dermis), full thickness. Rule of nines for surface area estimation (adults).

## Worked micro‑examples
1) Barrier disruption
- Stratum corneum compromise increases transepidermal water loss; infant skin differences increase susceptibility.

2) UV exposure
- Excess UVB damages DNA (pyrimidine dimers); p53‑mediated cell cycle arrest; long‑term risk for non‑melanoma skin cancers.

3) Sweat gland function
- Eccrine hypofunction impairs heat dissipation → heat exhaustion risk; hyperhidrosis management conceptually.

## Pitfalls
- Confusing gland types and secretions; misplacing mechanoreceptors by layer.
- Overlooking avascularity of epidermis (nutrient diffusion from dermis).

## Practice prompts
- Label epidermal layers and list cell types and functions per layer.
- Compare eccrine vs apocrine glands and their regulation.
- Outline wound healing stages and expected histology.
