# Anatomy – Respiratory (2026)

## Overview
Airway anatomy, gas exchange, mechanics, volumes, and control.

## High-Yield Topics
- Conducting vs respiratory zones; alveoli; surfactant
- Mechanics: compliance, resistance, work of breathing
- Volumes/capacities; dead space; V/Q relationships
- Gas transport; O₂ dissociation curve shifts
- Control centers; chemoreceptors

## Study Roadmap
1) Spirometry interpretation
2) V/Q mismatch scenarios (shunt vs dead space)
3) O₂ curve shifts (pH, temperature, CO₂, 2,3-BPG)
