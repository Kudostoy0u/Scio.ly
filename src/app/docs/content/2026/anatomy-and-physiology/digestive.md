## Overview
Digestive physiology coordinates mechanical processing, enzymatic breakdown, absorption, and motility across specialized regions.

## Anatomy and secretions (survey)
- Mouth: mastication; salivary amylase (starch) and lipase (minor; infants).
- Stomach: acid (HCl by parietal cells), pepsinogen → pepsin (protein), intrinsic factor; churning; pyloric regulation.
- Small intestine: duodenum (mixing/buffers; bile and pancreatic enzymes), jejunum (major absorption), ileum (B₁₂–IF and bile salts reabsorption).
- Accessory organs: liver (bile acids/salts), gallbladder (storage/concentration), pancreas (HCO₃⁻, amylase, lipase, proteases as zymogens: trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen; activation by enteropeptidase).
- Large intestine: water/electrolyte absorption; microbiota ferment fiber; vitamin K synthesis.

## Motility
- Peristalsis vs segmentation; migrating motor complex (MMC) during fasting; sphincters coordinate flow (LES, pyloric, ileocecal, anal).

## Digestion and absorption
- Carbohydrates: amylase → oligosaccharides; brush‑border enzymes (lactase, sucrase‑isomaltase) → monosaccharides; transporters (SGLT1 for glucose/galactose, GLUT5 for fructose).
- Proteins: gastric pepsin initiates; pancreatic proteases; brush‑border peptidases; absorption as amino acids/di‑tri‑peptides (PEPT1).
- Lipids: emulsification by bile salts → pancreatic lipase (with colipase) → 2‑monoacylglycerol + FFA; micelles deliver to enterocytes → re‑esterification → chylomicrons → lymphatics.
- Vitamins/minerals: iron (duodenum, Fe²⁺ favored; heme pathway), folate (jejunum), B₁₂ (ileum with intrinsic factor), Ca²⁺ (vitamin D‑regulated), bile acids (enterohepatic cycle).

## Regulation (survey)
- Neural: enteric nervous system (myenteric/submucosal plexuses); parasympathetic enhances motility/secretion.
- Hormonal: gastrin (↑acid), CCK (↑pancreatic enzymes, gallbladder contraction), secretin (↑HCO₃⁻), GIP/GLP‑1 (incretins; ↓gastric emptying, ↑insulin).

## Worked micro‑examples
1) Steatorrhea patterns
- Pancreatic insufficiency vs bile salt deficiency vs mucosal disease; predict stool fat and vitamin deficiencies (ADEK).

2) Lactase deficiency
- Osmotic diarrhea, bloating; normal small bowel biopsy; positive hydrogen breath test.

3) B₁₂ malabsorption
- Loss of terminal ileum or intrinsic factor → macrocytic anemia, neurologic findings; folate corrects anemia but not neuro signs.

## Pitfalls
- Confusing sites of absorption (iron duodenum vs B₁₂ ileum).
- Ignoring brush‑border roles in final carb/protein digestion.
- Overlooking enterohepatic circulation when reasoning about bile acid losses and fat‑soluble vitamin status.

## Practice prompts
- Map enzymes and transporters by region and predict outcomes of pancreatic enzyme blockade.
- Compare effects of CCK vs secretin on bile and pancreatic secretions.
- Explain why ileal resection causes gallstone risk (bile acid loss → cholesterol supersaturation).
