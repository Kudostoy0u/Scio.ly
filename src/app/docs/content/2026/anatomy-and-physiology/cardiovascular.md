## Overview
The cardiovascular system delivers oxygen and nutrients, removes wastes, and maintains pressure/flow homeostasis. Mastery requires linking anatomy and electrophysiology to hemodynamics and regulation.

## Anatomy and conduction
- Chambers/valves: RA (tricuspid) → RV (pulmonic) → LA (mitral) → LV (aortic). Valve function prevents backflow; papillary muscles/chordae stabilize AV valves.
- Conduction: SA node → atrial pathways → AV node (delay) → His bundle → bundle branches → Purkinje fibers; automaticity gradients.

## Cardiac cycle and sounds
- Phases: isovolumic contraction → ejection → isovolumic relaxation → rapid/diastasis filling → atrial systole.
- Heart sounds: S1 (AV closure), S2 (semilunar closure); physiologic splitting of S2 with inspiration; extra sounds (S3/S4) context (qualitative recognition).

## ECG basics
- P: atrial depolarization; PR interval reflects AV conduction. QRS: ventricular depolarization; width suggests conduction velocity. T: repolarization. Axis and intervals (PR 120–200 ms; QRS < 120 ms).

## Hemodynamics
- Ohm analog: ΔP = Q·R. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≈ (SBP + 2·DBP)/3; pulse pressure ≈ SBP − DBP; arterial compliance influences PP.
- Starling law: increased venous return → increased stroke volume (within limits) via sarcomere length‑tension relation.
- Microcirculation: Starling forces govern filtration/reabsorption; lymphatics return interstitial fluid; edema mechanisms (↑Pc, ↓πc, ↑Kf/↓σ, lymph obstruction).

## Regulation
- Baroreflex: carotid sinus/aortic arch stretch → autonomic adjustments in HR/contractility/vascular tone. Rapid buffering of BP.
- Chemoreflex and local control: CO₂/H⁺/O₂ influence ventilation and peripheral resistance; metabolic hyperemia matches flow to demand.
- RAAS (qualitative): renin → Ang II (vasoconstriction, aldosterone) → volume/pressure effects.

## Blood components
- Plasma vs formed elements; RBCs (hemoglobin), WBC differentials (qualitative), platelets and hemostasis overview.
- ABO/Rh basics: transfusion compatibility and hemolytic disease of the newborn (qualitative scope).

## Worked micro‑examples
1) Pressure–volume loop shift
- Increased afterload (hypertension) raises end‑systolic pressure/volume; stroke volume falls; discuss compensations (hypertrophy long‑term, Frank–Starling acutely).

2) Starling forces and edema
- Reduced plasma proteins (low πc) in liver disease favors filtration → edema; contrast with venous hypertension (↑Pc) in heart failure.

3) Baroreflex scenario
- Standing quickly: transient ↓venous return → ↓SV/MAP; baroreflex increases HR and vasoconstriction to restore MAP; failure leads to orthostatic hypotension.

## Pitfalls
- Confusing valve names/locations; misattributing S1/S2 to wrong valves.
- Ignoring compliance effects on pulse pressure with aging (stiffer arteries → higher PP).
- Mixing osmotic (πc) vs hydrostatic (Pc) roles in edema.

## Practice prompts
- Label a PV loop and identify effects of preload/afterload/inotropy changes.
- Trace conduction and annotate corresponding ECG segments/waves.
- Explain how arteriolar dilation in exercising muscle affects systemic vascular resistance and MAP.
