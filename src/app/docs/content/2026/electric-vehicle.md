# Electric Vehicle (2026)

Division: C  
Type: Build (Vehicle)  
Participants: 2  
Allowed Materials: Device components per rules; eye protection; impound

## Overview
Battery-powered vehicle travels a specified distance accurately and consistently.

## Core Topics
- Motor control; gearing; wheel calibration  
- Sensors/timers (as allowed); alignment and friction  
- Distance measurement and repeatability

## Deep dives
- Control: open-loop time-based vs sensor-based (encoders, optical gates) as rules allow; speed–torque curves; gearing selection
- Wheels: diameter calibration and wear; traction vs slip; alignment and toe
- Braking: mechanical stops, ramps, PID slow-down (if allowed), current limiting

## Calibration and logs
- Build calibration tables for distance vs time/turns; include temperature dependence
- Maintain run logs with setup, distance error, corrections; track drift over time

## Strategy
- Calibration routines and run logs  
- Mechanism for precise start/stop  
- Compliance with electrical/mechanical specs
