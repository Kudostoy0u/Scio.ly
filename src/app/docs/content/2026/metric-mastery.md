## Overview
Metric unit conversions, measurement estimation, instrument reading, and significant figures.

## Core Topics
- SI base/derived units; prefixes  
- Dimensional analysis; conversions  
- Estimation strategies; error and precision

## Strategy
- Memorize common conversions and prefixes  
- Practice timed estimation challenges  
- Instrument reading with realistic uncertainty

## Deep dives
- SI coherence: base vs derived units; dimensional analysis patterns
- Estimation anchors: human height/mass, room dimensions, everyday objects; orders of magnitude
- Instrument reading: analog vs digital; resolution vs accuracy; significant figures and rounding

## Practice bank
- Convert compound units (e.g., km/h to m/s, g/cm³ to kg/m³)
- Estimate: mass of a filled 500 mL bottle; area of a classroom; volume of a backpack
