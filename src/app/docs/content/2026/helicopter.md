# Helicopter (2026)

Divisions: B, C  
Type: Build (Flight)  
Participants: 2  
Allowed Materials: Device, rubber motors, eye protection, logs; impound rules

## Overview
Rubber-powered helicopter for maximum flight time; optimize rotor design, mass, and rubber winding strategy.

## Core Topics
- Rotor geometry, pitch, blade area, wash  
- Rubber motor selection, winding/torque  
- Trimming, launch, ceiling interactions

## Deep dives
- Rotor aerodynamics (qualitative): angle of attack vs induced drag; planform; washout for stall resistance
- Rubber motors: torque curves with winds; lube; braid/unbraid techniques; breaking-in and batch variability
- Mass distribution: center of gravity, tail/boom stability; minimized parasitic mass
- Trimming: low winds for trim, high winds for max; ceiling hits handling (torque burst vs steady)

## Logs and calibration
- Flight logs: winds, turns at launch, peak altitude, duration, ceiling interactions, temperature/humidity
- Motor logs: length, weight, max safe winds, energy trends

## Strategy
- Build multiple rotor sets; tune motors  
- Maintain detailed flight logs  
- Practice in similar-height venues
