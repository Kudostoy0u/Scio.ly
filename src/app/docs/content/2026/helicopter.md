## Overview
Indoor helicopters seek maximum duration via efficient rotor aerodynamics, tuned rubber motors, and meticulous trimming.

## Rotor aerodynamics (qualitative)
- Lift and drag: lift ∝ velocity² and blade area; induced drag rises with lift; profile drag rises with speed and angle of attack (AoA).
- Pitch and washout: set AoA for low Reynolds numbers; add washout (lower AoA near tips) to mitigate tip stall and improve efficiency.
- Planform: larger disk area lowers induced power; weight and structural stiffness limit radius.

## Rubber motor tuning
- Torque–turns curve: high torque initially, decays as unwinding; match rotor load to torque profile for steady climb and slow descent.
- Lubrication and braiding: reduce hysteresis; store energy safely; track maximum safe winds.
- Motor selection: length, width, and density; batch variability requires testing; record temperature/humidity.

## Trimming and flight strategy
- Climb phase: manage torque burst to avoid ceiling bumps; reduce pitch or turns to moderate initial climb.
- Cruise/descend: aim for slow, stable rotation without stall; lateral stability via slight tilt or fin/rudder if allowed.
- Ceiling interactions: plan for controlled brushes if venue permits; otherwise reduce initial torque to avoid contact.

## Structure and mass
- Keep center of gravity aligned; minimize parasitic mass; ensure straight shafts/booms; balance blades to reduce vibration.
- Joints: cyanoacrylate with reinforcements at high‑stress points; avoid warps.

## Calibration and logs
- Flight logs: winds at launch, peak height, duration, ceiling contacts; motor logs: length, mass, max winds, wind‑down profiles.
- Environmental conditions: temperature/humidity influence rubber and air density; adjust wind counts accordingly.

## Worked micro‑examples
1) Disk loading
- For constant mass, increasing rotor radius reduces disk loading (W/Area), improving duration until structural/venue limits.

2) Torque matching
- If initial climb is excessive, reduce initial winds by 10–15% or lower pitch by ~0.5–1°; verify with climb rate logs.

3) Washout effect
- Introducing 2–3° washout at tips reduces stall and improves late‑flight stability; observe smoother descent.

## Pitfalls
- Excess pitch causing tip stall; unbalanced blades inducing wobble and energy loss.
- Over‑winding beyond safe turns; failing to re‑lube consistently.
- Inconsistent launch techniques; poor documentation.

## Practice prompts
- Design a test plan to select motor dimensions for a given rotor load; include log templates.
- Measure and adjust blade pitch/washout with simple jigs; correlate with duration changes.
- Plan a torque‑matching strategy across low/medium/high ceilings.
