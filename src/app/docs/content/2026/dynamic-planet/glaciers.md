## Overview
Glaciers form where snowfall persists and compacts into ice, flow under their own weight, and sculpt landscapes through erosion and deposition. This section covers formation, thermal regimes, motion, mass balance and ELA, glacial hydrology, landforms, climate links, and practical calculations.

## Learning Objectives
- Describe firnification from snow to glacial ice and define the equilibrium line altitude (ELA).
- Distinguish warm-based (temperate) vs. cold-based (polar) glaciers and their geomorphic signatures.
- Explain glacier motion mechanisms (internal deformation, basal sliding, subglacial till deformation).
- Interpret glacier budgets, calculate simple mass balance and velocity from stake data, and estimate ELA from hypsometry.
- Identify erosional and depositional glacial landforms on maps and imagery.

## Formation and Thermal Regimes
- **Accumulation vs. ablation**: net gain by snowfall/drift/rime vs. loss by melt/sublimation/calving.
- **Firn → ice**: snow compacts to firn (~0.4–0.8 g/cm³), then recrystallizes into ice (~>0.83 g/cm³).
- **ELA**: altitude where annual net balance is zero; separates accumulation area (above) from ablation area (below).
- **Thermal types**: temperate (at pressure-melting point; abundant meltwater; efficient erosion) vs. polar (below melting; frozen beds; limited erosion); polythermal glaciers mix behaviors.

## Motion and Structures
- **Internal deformation** (creep) dominates in cold interiors; deformation increases with ice thickness and slope (concept: Glen’s flow law).
- **Basal sliding** occurs over lubricated beds; enhanced by meltwater and regelation around obstacles.
- **Subglacial till deformation** contributes in soft-bedded systems.
- **Velocity profile**: fastest near surface/center; slower at margins/basal ice due to friction.
- **Crevasses**: brittle upper ice fractures where strain exceeds strength—transverse (extensional flow), longitudinal (compressional flow), chevron (shear), bergschrund near headwalls.

## Mass Balance and Response
- **Specific balance**: b = c − a (accumulation minus ablation). Annual balance integrates over the glacier area to give net mass change.
- **Hypsometry**: area–elevation distribution; ELA can be estimated by the accumulation-area ratio (AAR) method (common AAR ~0.5–0.7 for many valley glaciers, but varies by climate/region).
- **Response time**: years to decades (small valley glaciers) to centuries (ice sheets). Thinning/thickening waves propagate down-glacier with lag.

## Glacial Hydrology and Hazards
- **Drainage pathways**: supraglacial streams, englacial conduits, subglacial channels (R-channels) and distributed systems (linked cavities). Seasonal switch from distributed to channelized systems.
- **Jökulhlaups**: sudden outburst floods from subglacial lakes or ice-dammed basins.
- **Calving**: dominant ablation for tidewater/lake-terminating glaciers; produces icebergs.

## Landforms and Evidence
- **Erosional**: cirques, horns, arêtes, U-shaped valleys, hanging valleys, fjords; roche moutonnée with stoss/lee asymmetry; striations/grooves show ice flow direction.
- **Depositional**: moraines (lateral, medial, terminal, recessional), drumlins (streamlined till hills), eskers (sinuous sand/gravel ridges), kames/kettles, outwash plains (sandur), varves (annual lake couplets), erratics.
- **Isostatic rebound**: crust uplifts after deglaciation; raised shorelines and tilted lake terraces.

## Calculations and Examples
- Stake velocity: marker moves 36 m over 90 days → 0.4 m/day ≈ 146 m/yr.
- Simple mass balance: accumulation 1.2 m w.e., ablation 1.6 m w.e. → b = −0.4 m w.e. (net loss).
- ELA via AAR: if accumulation area is 12 km² and total area 20 km², AAR = 0.6; choose elevation where cumulative area above equals ~60% as ELA estimate.

## Advanced topics (qualitative)
- Surging glaciers: short-lived speedups due to subglacial hydrology and thermal conditions; leave looped moraines/contorted flowlines
- Debris-covered glaciers: suppressed melt under thick debris; enhanced melt at thin debris and ice cliffs; kettle formation
- Tidewater glacier cycle: calving dynamics, terminus stability, and climate vs geometry controls

## Map and Image Skills
- Identify glacial landforms on shaded relief or aerial images; infer former ice flow directions from drumlins/striations.
- Delineate moraines and reconstruct glacier retreat sequences using recessional moraines and varved lake sediments.
- Use topographic profiles to recognize U-shaped valley cross-sections vs. V-shaped fluvial valleys.

## Practice Prompts
1. Given an area–elevation histogram and seasonal snow/wind data, estimate the ELA and justify the chosen AAR.
2. A glacier transitions from distributed to channelized drainage in late spring. Predict changes in water pressure and sliding speed.
3. Distinguish between drumlins and roche moutonnée in the field based on shape and stoss/lee asymmetry.
