## Overview
Plate tectonics explains the global patterns of earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain belts, and ocean basins by the motions of rigid plates over a ductile mantle. Study efficiently by learning how each boundary type expresses itself in topography, seismicity, and magmatism, how magnetic anomalies and hotspot chains encode plate motion, and how simple isostasy and seafloor‑age trends set first‑order elevation.

## Boundaries, subduction, and orogeny
Divergent boundaries build new oceanic crust at ridges and rifts; normal faulting, basaltic volcanism, and transform offsets create the ridge–transform system. Convergent boundaries recycle lithosphere: ocean–continent subduction builds volcanic arcs above dehydrating slabs, ocean–ocean subduction forms island arcs, and continent–continent collision thickens and uplifts crust to make ranges such as the Himalaya. Subducting slabs trace inclined Wadati–Benioff zones; slab dip, convergence rate, and slab age set arc position and hazard style. Back‑arc basins open where rollback or trench retreat induces extension behind arcs. Transform boundaries accommodate lateral motion with strike‑slip faulting; restraining and releasing bends produce local uplifts and basins.

## Absolute and relative motions
Magnetic stripes symmetrically flanking ridges record seafloor age and allow spreading‑rate estimates from age–distance plots; fracture zones mark fossil transform offsets where same‑age crust aligns across the zone but differs along it. Hotspot tracks provide absolute plate motion directions and speeds under the assumption of quasi‑fixed mantle sources, with bends (e.g., Hawaii–Emperor) capturing changes in plate trajectories. On average, seafloor deepens with the square root of age as the lithosphere cools and thickens, while isostasy explains why thicker, less dense continental crust stands higher and carries a deeper root.

## Seismology and volcanism in context
P and S waves travel differently through Earth’s interior (S waves fail in liquids), and S–P arrival time differences give epicentral distances for basic location. Focal mechanisms (“beachballs”) summarize fault orientations and motion sense, matching expected styles at each boundary. Volcanic products follow tectonic setting: low‑viscosity basalts at ridges and hotspots, more viscous andesites/dacites in arcs where fluids lower mantle wedge solidus, and evolved compositions where crustal processing is significant.

## Quick relations and checks
- Half‑spreading rate comes from ridge‑to‑anomaly distance divided by age; full rate doubles it.
- Simple Airy isostasy argues that thicker crust yields higher elevation and deeper roots when densities are fixed.

## Practice prompts
- From a magnetic anomaly profile with ages, compute half‑ and full‑spreading rates and comment on symmetry between flanks.
- Using a cross‑section of earthquakes beneath a trench, estimate slab dip and sketch where the volcanic arc should stand.
- Given a seamount chain with ages along track, estimate plate speed and describe the meaning of a pronounced bend.
