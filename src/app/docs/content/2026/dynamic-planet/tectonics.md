# Dynamic Planet – Tectonics (2026)

## Overview
Plate tectonics explains the distribution of earthquakes, volcanoes, mountains, ocean basins, and many resources. This section covers plate types and boundaries, subduction and orogeny, hotspots and plumes, seafloor spreading and magnetic anomalies, isostasy, basic seismology, and hazard interpretation.

## Learning Objectives
- Classify boundaries and predict associated structures, magmas, and hazards.
- Use magnetic anomaly profiles and hotspot chains to estimate plate velocities.
- Explain forces driving plate motions and the Wilson Cycle of ocean opening and closing.
- Apply simple isostasy concepts to crustal thickness and elevation problems.
- Interpret earthquake focal mechanisms and Wadati–Benioff zones qualitatively.

## Plates and Boundaries
- **Plate types**: oceanic (mafic, denser, thinner) vs. continental (felsic, less dense, thicker).
- **Divergent**: mid-ocean ridges, rift valleys; normal faulting; basaltic volcanism; transform offsets (ridge–transform system).
- **Convergent**: ocean–continent (Andean arc), ocean–ocean (island arcs like Marianas), continent–continent (Himalaya). Features: trenches, forearc/volcanic arc/back-arc, accretionary prisms.
- **Transform**: strike-slip motion; offset ridges or continental faults (San Andreas); restraining/releasing bends create localized uplift/basins.
- **Triple junctions**: ridge–ridge–ridge common; stability depends on relative motion geometry.

## Subduction, Orogeny, and Back-Arc Basins
- **Subduction**: downgoing slab generates fluids from dehydration → flux melting in mantle wedge → arc volcanism (andesite/dacite common). Slab dip, age, and convergence rate control geometry and hazards.
- **Wadati–Benioff**: inclined seismic zone marks slab; deep earthquakes primarily in subduction.
- **Back-arc**: extension behind arcs due to slab rollback or trench retreat; back-arc spreading centers form.
- **Orogeny**: mountain building via collision, arc accretion, crustal thickening, and metamorphism; exhumation and isostatic rebound follow.

## Hotspots and Absolute Plate Motion
- **Hotspot tracks**: intra-plate volcanism with age-progressive chains (Hawaii–Emperor). Bends record changes in plate motion.
- **Plate speed**: v ≈ distance/age. Example: 1,200 km between 0–20 Ma → ~60 km/Ma (~60 mm/yr).
- **Plumes vs. shallow sources**: debate exists; for problems, use idealized deep, fixed plumes unless specified otherwise.

## Seafloor Spreading and Magnetic Anomalies
- **Magnetic stripes**: symmetric bands of normal/reversed polarity record seafloor age; used to compute half- and full-spreading rates.
- **Age–distance plots**: slope gives rate; faster at East Pacific Rise, slower at Mid-Atlantic Ridge.
- **Fracture zones**: fossil transform faults; offset age contrasts on either side but same-age crust across the zone.

## Isostasy and Lithosphere–Asthenosphere
- **Isostasy**: floating balance. Airy model (variable thickness), Pratt model (variable density). Thicker/less-dense crust stands higher and has deeper roots.
- **Lithospheric cooling**: oceanic lithosphere thickens and subsides with age (square-root-of-age seafloor depth trend).
- **Dynamic topography**: mantle flow can elevate/depress regions beyond isostatic predictions (qualitative).

## Earthquakes and Volcanoes
- **Seismic waves**: P (compressional), S (shear; no liquids), surface waves (L/R) cause most damage. S–P time gives distance to epicenter; multiple stations triangulate.
- **Focal mechanisms**: “beachballs” show fault plane solutions; compressional quadrants vs. dilatational.
- **Volcano types**: shield (basaltic), stratovolcano (andesitic), caldera systems; magma composition controls viscosity/explosivity; tectonic setting informs magma source.

## Calculations and Examples
- Half-spreading rate: distance from ridge to a 4 Ma anomaly is 120 km → 30 mm/yr half rate; full rate ~60 mm/yr.
- Hotspot chain velocity: 600 km between 5–15 Ma centers → 60 km/Ma.
- Simple Airy isostasy reasoning: adding 1 km of low-density crust increases elevation and root depth; proportionality depends on crust/mantle densities (qualitative unless numbers provided).
- S–P time to distance: if local travel-time curves show 1 s S–P ≈ 8 km, then 6 s gap implies ~48 km to epicenter (numbers vary by region—use provided tables).

## Advanced topics (qualitative)
- Slab pull vs ridge push; trench rollback; flat slab subduction examples
- Back-arc extension vs compression; forearc basins and accretionary wedges
- Supercontinent cycles; assembly and breakup signatures in paleomag and stratigraphy

## Map and Data Skills
- Identify boundary types from bathymetry/topography and seismicity patterns; recognize Wadati–Benioff dips.
- Use magnetic anomaly labels to compute rates; watch for asymmetry when spreading rates differ by flank.
- Read hotspot age labels on seamount chains to infer motion direction and potential bends.

## Practice Prompts
1. Given a magnetic anomaly profile and age key, compute half- and full-spreading rates and comment on symmetry.
2. A forearc shows uplifted marine terraces. What does this imply about interplate coupling and seismic hazard?
3. From an earthquake catalog cross-section, estimate slab dip and identify the likely volcanic arc position.

## Glossary
- Back-arc basin: extensional region behind a volcanic arc.
- Benioff zone: inclined seismic zone along a subducting slab.
- Isostasy: gravitational equilibrium of floating lithosphere.
- Ridge–transform system: segmented ridge with strike-slip offsets.
- Wilson Cycle: opening and closing of ocean basins through rifting, spreading, subduction, and collision.
