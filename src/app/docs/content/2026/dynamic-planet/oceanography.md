# Dynamic Planet – Oceanography (2026)

## DESCRIPTION (Scope and Depth)
Teams will complete tasks related to physical and geological oceanography. At a textbook level, that means connecting fundamental conservation laws and forces (momentum, mass, energy; pressure gradients, Coriolis, buoyancy) to the observed structure of the ocean—from surface waves and tides to wind‑driven gyres and the abyssal overturning circulation. Geological oceanography underpins the setting: continental margins, abyssal plains, mid‑ocean ridges, fracture zones, and trenches, as well as sedimentary processes and coastal geomorphology.

The goals are to (i) understand how seawater properties (temperature, salinity, density, tracers) and boundary forcings (radiation and turbulent fluxes, winds, freshwater/heat) shape the water column; (ii) analyze circulation at the surface (Ekman, geostrophic) and at depth (water‑mass pathways and overturning); (iii) explain and compute basic wave and tide relationships; and (iv) interpret maps, sections, and time series with quantitative reasoning. The event emphasizes process skills and data interpretation over rote memorization.

## Learning Objectives
- Explain how temperature and salinity control density and stratification; interpret T–S diagrams qualitatively.
- Describe Ekman transport, geostrophic balance, and western intensification of subtropical gyres.
- Distinguish surface- vs. deep-water formation and pathways in the Atlantic and Pacific basins.
- Describe wave characteristics and transformations, and the basics of tides and tidal patterns.
- Interpret coastal features and sediment transport by waves and currents.

## EVENT PARAMETERS (Binder and Calculators)
Binder (2" or smaller three‑ring) may contain information in any form and from any source, with sheet protectors, lamination, tabs, and labels permitted. For station‑based events where participants interact with samples/specimens/displays, materials must remain in the binder throughout. Two stand‑alone calculators of any type are allowed.

Binder strategy at advanced level
- Structure the binder by the rulebook topic order; place a one‑page “maps and units” primer up front (constants g, ρ0, Coriolis f scale, conversion factors; wave/tide quick formulas).  
- Include mini‑workflows for common tasks: identifying thermoclines/pycnoclines from profiles; computing density differences and stability; reading sea surface height and inferring geostrophic currents; wave shoaling/refraction steps; quick triage of estuary types from S/T/S density stratification; recognizing ridge/trench/transform on bathymetry.  
- Add exemplar solved problems (short) for each formula with units and order‑of‑magnitude checks; reserve a section for map/imagery interpretation checklists (what to look for first, common pitfalls like mismatched axes or linear vs log scale).  
- Tabs for (i) seawater/density; (ii) fluxes/MLD; (iii) waves/tides; (iv) surface circulation; (v) deep circulation/water masses; (vi) coasts/estuaries; (vii) seafloor/tectonics; (viii) observing systems.

Calculator guidance
- Ensure facility with unit conversions, square‑roots, and scientific notation for wave/tide/velocity scales; practice back‑of‑envelope checks (e.g., shallow water speed √(g·d) ≈ 10 m/s at 10 m depth).  
- For station formats, pre‑annotate where to find formulas and keep scratch paper behind each topic tab for quick set‑ups.

## Process Skills and Data Workflows
Oceanography questions reward method as much as facts. Develop a disciplined approach that you can execute quickly at stations.

### Core process skills (with ocean examples)
- Observing: describe what the data show before explaining why. Example: “Temperature decreases rapidly from 20 m to 100 m, then is nearly isothermal—strong seasonal thermocline over deep near‑uniform water.”  
- Measuring: extract quantitative values from plots/maps with units and uncertainty. Example: “SSH gradient ≈ 0.15 m over 200 km → slope 7.5×10⁻⁷.”  
- Classifying: group features by diagnostic traits (e.g., estuary types by salinity structure; coasts as erosional vs depositional; currents as western vs eastern boundary).  
- Communicating: annotate diagrams (profiles, cross‑sections) with clear labels, arrows for flow directions, and brief captions; write one‑sentence takeaways.  
- Inferring: connect patterns to processes (e.g., upwelling indicated by cold surface tongues co‑located with equatorward alongshore winds; U‑shaped valleys imply glacial carving).  
- Predicting: project consequences of a change (e.g., stronger trades → enhanced equatorial upwelling; increased river discharge → stronger salt wedge).  
- Using number relationships: apply scaling/limits to sanity‑check results—wave celerity √(g·d), Rossby radius O(√(g'H)/f) (Division C qualitative), and order‑of‑magnitude checks.

### Standard data workflows
1) Vertical profiles (T, S, σθ, O₂, nutrients)  
   - Steps: mark mixed layer depth (MLD) where density gradient strengthens; identify thermocline/pycnocline; note inversions or intrusions; compare to climatological ranges.  
   - Products: sketch profile, label layers, compute ΔT/Δz or Δσθ/Δz over key intervals; annotate T–S points for water‑mass inference.

2) Sections (distance–depth transects)  
   - Steps: trace isotherms/isohalines/isopycnals; identify fronts (tight packing) and eddies (lens‑shaped anomalies); infer geostrophic shear (tilted isopycnals).  
   - Products: a cross‑section with arrows for expected flow (along isobars), notes on stratification, and estimates of feature widths/depths.

3) Maps (SSH/SST/chlorophyll/wind)  
   - Steps: read color bar and contour interval; identify western boundary currents (sharp SSH gradients), eddies (closed contours), upwelling (cool SST near coasts aligned with favorable winds), and chlorophyll blooms downstream of upwelling.  
   - Products: list 3–4 features with coordinates/regions, hypothesize mechanisms, and suggest an observational test (e.g., along‑track altimetry or ADCP section). 

4) Time series  
   - Steps: note periodicity (tides, sea breeze, seasonal cycle), step changes (interventions), and trends (warming). Detrend mentally to see anomalies; compute simple amplitudes and phase lags.  
   - Products: identify dominant periods (e.g., semidiurnal tides), approximate amplitudes, and relate to forcing (spring/neap, ENSO events).

5) Gridding and interpolation (conceptual)  
   - Recognize that maps/sections often reflect objective analyses of sparse data; honor data density and avoid over‑interpretation where sampling is coarse. State uncertainty: “Feature suggested; confirm with additional profiles.”

### Rapid triage template at a station
1) Identify data types (profile/section/map/time series) and units.  
2) Write three observations (what/where/how much).  
3) Compute one or two key numbers (MLD, ΔT, slope, C ≈ √(g·d)).  
4) State a mechanism and a concise conclusion; if uncertain, propose the next measurement.

## Seawater: Composition, Salinity, Density, and T–S Analysis
Ocean water is a multicomponent solution whose bulk properties are dominated by a handful of ions and whose variations in temperature (T), salinity (S), and pressure (p) control density and stratification. Mastery of composition, salinity scales, and the density equation of state is essential for interpreting water‑mass structure and circulation.

### Composition and the law of constant proportions
Major ions (≈99.9% by mass of dissolved constituents) are remarkably uniform in relative abundance across the open ocean: chloride (Cl⁻), sodium (Na⁺), sulfate (SO₄²⁻), magnesium (Mg²⁺), calcium (Ca²⁺), potassium (K⁺), and bicarbonate/carbonate (HCO₃⁻/CO₃²⁻). This “law of constant proportions” (Forchhammer/Dittmar) means that salinity can be inferred from a conservative tracer of the major ions (historically chlorinity). Sources of sea salts include weathering of continental rocks and hydrothermal inputs; sinks include mineral precipitation, biogenic uptake for carbonates, and burial. Minor and trace constituents (nutrients, oxygen, metals, and transient tracers) vary strongly in space/time and record biogeochemical processes and ventilation.

### Salinity: scales, sources/sinks, and patterns
Salinity quantifies dissolved constituents. Historically, Practical Salinity (SP, “PSU”) was defined by conductivity (PSS‑78); modern thermodynamics (TEOS‑10) use Absolute Salinity (SA, g kg⁻¹) and Conservative Temperature (Θ) for heat content. In competition contexts you will typically encounter SP (dimensionless or “psu”)—use whichever the problem provides and be consistent.

Sources/sinks and patterns
- Evaporation minus precipitation (E−P) sets broad subtropical highs (salty) and subpolar/intertropical fresh pools.  
- River discharge and ice melt freshen coastal/high‑latitude regions; brine rejection during sea‑ice formation increases local salinity and density.  
- Restricted basins with strong net evaporation (Mediterranean, Red Sea) produce high‑salinity outflows at sill depths recognizably salty in downstream T–S space.  
- Estuaries exhibit strong horizontal and vertical salinity gradients governed by river flow, tidal mixing, and geometry (salt wedge → well‑mixed sequence).

Vertical structure
- Mixed layer (air–sea fluxes and wind‑driven mixing): often nearly uniform S; seasonal changes driven by E−P and mixing depth.  
- Pycnocline/thermocline: salinity and temperature gradients combine to form a stable density stratification that resists vertical exchange.  
- Deep water: small S variability but sufficient to affect density when combined with T and p.

### Density and the equation of state
Density depends on salinity, temperature, and pressure: ρ = ρ(S, T, p). Cold and salty increases ρ; warming and freshening decrease ρ; compression at depth also increases ρ. For quantitative work, two notational families are common:
- σ_t = ρ(S,T, p=0) − 1000 (kg m⁻³) using in‑situ T at surface pressure.  
- Potential density referenced to pressure levels: σ₀, σ₂, σ₄ for p≈0, 2000, 4000 dbar, respectively (accounts for compressibility during adiabatic displacement).  
Under TEOS‑10, Absolute Salinity (SA) and Conservative Temperature (Θ) improve heat/salt conservation; conceptually, the same ideas apply—potential density referenced to a pressure surface is used to compare parcels displaced adiabatically.

Expansion and contraction coefficients
- Thermal expansion α ≡ (1/ρ)(∂ρ/∂T)_S,p < 0 (density decreases when T increases).  
- Haline contraction β ≡ −(1/ρ)(∂ρ/∂S)_T,p > 0 (density increases when S increases).  
These determine buoyancy changes for given T/S perturbations and appear in linearized stability and mixing arguments.

Nonlinearities: cabbeling and thermobaricity
- Cabbeling: mixing two water parcels of equal density but different T/S can produce a mixture that is denser than either parent because ρ(S,T) is nonlinear. This promotes downwelling at strong fronts where mixing occurs.  
- Thermobaricity: the temperature dependence of density strengthens with pressure; at depth, a small cooling can increase density more than at the surface, influencing deep convection pathways.

Stability and the buoyancy frequency
Static stability requires density to increase with depth. The squared Brunt–Väisälä (buoyancy) frequency \(N^2 = -\frac{g}{\rho}\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial z} \) (s⁻²) is positive for stable stratification. Large \(N^2\) indicates strong resistance to vertical motion; small \(N^2\) a weakly stratified or mixed layer. You often do not need to compute \(N^2\) explicitly—recognize that sharp pycnoclines imply large \(N^2\) and inhibit mixing.

### T–S diagrams and water‑mass analysis
T–S space compactly displays water properties and mixing lines. Water masses occupy characteristic T–S ranges (e.g., NADW: cold, moderately salty; AABW: very cold, relatively fresh; AAIW: low salinity at intermediate depths). Linear mixing appears as straight lines between end‑members in T–S space; curvature hints at cabbeling or non‑linear effects. Potential density contours (σ_θ) overlaid on a T–S diagram help identify which mixtures are denser and likely to sink.

How to use T–S plots rapidly
- Plot a few representative points from profiles (surface, thermocline, intermediate minimum, deep).  
- Identify intrusions (e.g., salty Mediterranean outflow at mid‑depths) and fresh lenses (mode waters, river plumes).  
- Infer potential mixing pathways and likely source regions by matching to canonical water‑mass ranges; confirm with oxygen/nutrient fingerprints when given.

### Worked reasoning examples (qualitative)
- A profile shows surface S=34.1, Θ=22°C; thermocline minimum Θ=6°C, S=34.7; deep Θ=2°C, S=34.9. Density increases monotonically with depth; the salinity maximum at thermocline reflects subtropical subduction of salty surface water (mode water).  
- Two parcels A(Θ=8°C, S=35.4) and B(Θ=2°C, S=34.8) have similar σ₀; mixing them can yield a denser parcel (cabbeling), promoting sinking along a front.

## Radiative and Turbulent Heat Budgets; Mixed Layer and Entrainment
Sea surface temperature (SST) evolves under a balance of air–sea fluxes and mixed‑layer dynamics. Understanding signs, magnitudes, and bulk parameterizations lets you estimate tendencies and interpret seasonal cycles.

### Surface energy balance (sign conventions and components)
Let positive flux warm the ocean. The net surface heat flux is
\[Q_{net} = Q_{SW} + Q_{LW} + Q_H + Q_E + Q_{geo}\]
where:
- Shortwave radiation \(Q_{SW} = (1-\alpha)\,SW_{\downarrow}\) (α = albedo): daytime positive; globally largest contributor to warming.  
- Longwave radiation \(Q_{LW} = LW_{\downarrow} - LW_{\uparrow}\) where \(LW_{\uparrow} \approx \epsilon\sigma T_s^4\) (ε≈0.97). Net longwave typically cools the ocean (negative).  
- Sensible heat \(Q_H\) (turbulent) and latent heat \(Q_E\) (evaporative) are bulk‑flux terms, usually cooling (negative), strongest over warm, dry, windy regions (subtropical oceans, western boundary currents).  
- Geothermal \(Q_{geo}\) ≈ 0.05–0.1 W m⁻²: negligible for mixed‑layer budgets but matters over geologic time.

Typical magnitudes (order of W m⁻²)
- Daytime \(Q_{SW}\) up to +200 to +250 (clear subtropics); net daily +50 to +100 after diurnal cycle.  
- \(Q_{LW}\) ≈ −40 to −60; \(Q_E\) ≈ −50 to −200 (subtropics stronger); \(Q_H\) ≈ −10 to −50.  
- Patterns: tropics/subtropics net negative turbulent fluxes (evaporative cooling) partly offset shortwave; mid–high latitudes seasonal swings dominate.

### Bulk formulae (structure; know proportionalities)
Turbulent fluxes scale with wind speed and air–sea property differences:
\[ Q_H = \rho_a c_{p,a} C_H U (T_a - T_s) \quad ; \quad Q_E = \rho_a L_v C_E U (q_a - q_s) \]
\(\rho_a\) air density, \(c_{p,a}\) air heat capacity, \(L_v\) latent heat of vaporization, \(C_H, C_E\) transfer coefficients (\(\sim 10^{-3}\)), \(U\) wind speed, \(T_a, T_s\) air and sea surface temperatures, and \(q_a, q_s\) humidities at reference and surface. Signs: if \(T_a<T_s\) and \(q_a<q_s\), fluxes are negative (ocean cooling). You rarely need to compute these explicitly—recognize dependences: stronger winds → larger |\(Q_H, Q_E\)|; dry, cold air outbreaks → intense cooling.

### Mixed layer depth (MLD) and entrainment cooling
The upper‑ocean mixed layer integrates surface fluxes. To first order,
\[ \frac{dT_{ml}}{dt} \approx \frac{Q_{net}}{\rho_w c_{p,w} h} - w_e \frac{(T_{ml} - T_{b})}{h} \]
where \(h\) is MLD, \(\rho_w c_{p,w} \approx 4\times 10^6\,\mathrm{J\,m^{-3}\,K^{-1}}\) is seawater volumetric heat capacity, and \(w_e\) is entrainment rate bringing cooler water (\(T_b\)) into the mixed layer as it deepens. Positive \(Q_{net}\) warms the mixed layer; deepening (entrainment) cools it by mixing with colder water below the thermocline.

Rule of thumb (SST tendency)
- For \(h=50\,\mathrm{m}\) and \(Q_{net}=+100\,\mathrm{W\,m^{-2}}\), \(dT/dt \approx Q/(\rho c_p h) \approx 100 / (2\times10^8) \approx 5\times10^{-7}\,\mathrm{K\,s^{-1}} \approx 0.04\,\mathrm{K\,day^{-1}}\).  
- Thus even sustained 100 W m⁻² warming changes SST by only a few hundredths K per day without entrainment; strong cold‑air outbreaks (large negative \(Q_{net}\)) can induce rapid cooling, especially with deepening MLD.

### Seasonal cycle archetypes
- Subtropical gyres: summer shallow MLD, strong shortwave; winter deep MLD, strong evaporative/sensible cooling, mode‑water formation on isopycnals subducts high‑salinity anomalies.  
- Eastern boundary upwelling: persistent evaporative cooling enhanced by cold upwelled water; surface temperature controlled by wind‑driven upwelling more than by local \(Q_{net}\).  
- High latitudes: strong seasonal \(Q_{net}\) swings; winter convection can ventilate intermediate/deep waters when buoyancy loss overcomes stratification.

### Meridional heat transport (constraints and context)
The ocean transports heat poleward, complementing atmospheric transport. Peak oceanic meridional heat transport is O(1–2 PW) (1 PW = 10¹⁵ W) around 20–30° latitude; in the Atlantic, ≈1 PW northward near 25°N. Constraints arise from integrating hydrographic sections with geostrophy (inverse methods) and from satellite top‑of‑atmosphere radiation (ocean + atmosphere must balance net radiation). Qualitatively, boundary currents and the overturning circulation carry most of this transport; eddies redistribute heat laterally within basins.
## Properties of Seawater and Stratification
- **Salinity** (~35 PSU open ocean) set by evaporation–precipitation, river input, ice formation/melt.
- **Temperature** structure: mixed layer, thermocline, deep isothermal waters; seasonal thermocline in mid-latitudes.
- **Density** increases with salinity, decreases with temperature; stable stratification resists vertical mixing.
- **T–S diagrams**: water masses (e.g., NADW, AABW, AAIW) identified by characteristic T–S ranges and potential density.

## Wind-Driven Surface Circulation: Ekman, Geostrophy, Gyres, Upwelling
Wind stress, Earth’s rotation, and density gradients jointly set the surface circulation. Know the canonical balances and how to turn maps of wind or sea surface height (SSH) into current inferences.

### Ekman layer and transport
- Under steady uniform wind on an f‑plane with eddy viscosity, the Ekman spiral yields a surface current deflected ~20–45° to the wind (right in NH, left in SH) with velocity rotating and decaying with depth on a scale \(\delta_E \sim \sqrt{2A_v/|f|}\).  
- The depth‑integrated Ekman transport per unit width is
\[ \mathbf{M}_E = \frac{\mathbf{k} \times \boldsymbol{\tau}}{\rho_0 f} \]
where \(\boldsymbol{\tau}\) is wind stress, \(\rho_0\) water density, \(f\) Coriolis parameter, and \(\mathbf{k}\) is the upward unit vector. Transport is 90° to wind (right in NH).

Ekman pumping/suction
- Spatially varying wind stress drives vertical motion at the base of the Ekman layer:  
\[ w_E \approx \frac{1}{\rho_0 f}\,\mathrm{curl}_z\,\boldsymbol{\tau} \] 
(on approximately constant f). Positive curl (NH) gives upwelling (negative vertical velocity convention may be used; follow the problem’s sign).  
- Coastal upwelling: alongshore equatorward winds in the NH drive offshore Ekman transport, drawing cold, nutrient‑rich water up. Reversals cause downwelling.

Worked example (Ekman transport)
- Given \(|\boldsymbol{\tau}|=0.1\,\mathrm{N\,m^{-2}}\), \(f=10^{-4}\,\mathrm{s^{-1}}\), \(\rho_0=1025\,\mathrm{kg\,m^{-3}}\): \(|\mathbf{M}_E| \approx 0.1/(1025\times10^{-4}) \approx 9.8\,\mathrm{m^2\,s^{-1}}\) per meter of coastline, directed 90° to the right of wind (NH).

### Geostrophic balance and sea surface height slopes
- For large‑scale, slowly varying flows away from boundaries, horizontal pressure‑gradient force balances Coriolis:
\[ f\,\mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{u}_g = -\frac{1}{\rho_0}\nabla p \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{u}_g = \frac{g}{f}\,\mathbf{k}\times\nabla \eta \]
where \(\eta\) is SSH. Currents flow along SSH contours with higher sea level on the right of the flow in the NH.

Worked example (SSH to speed)
- SSH drop of 0.20 m over 200 km gives slope \(\partial\eta/\partial x \approx 1.0\times10^{-6}\). With \(g=9.81\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-2}}\), \(f=10^{-4}\,\mathrm{s^{-1}}\): \(v_g \approx -(g/f)\,\partial\eta/\partial x \approx -0.098\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-1}}\) (≈10 cm/s), south‑to‑north sign depends on axis choice.

Thermal wind (qualitative)
- Vertical shear of geostrophic flow is set by horizontal density gradients: \(\partial\mathbf{u}_g/\partial z = (g/(f\rho_0))\,\mathbf{k}\times\nabla\rho\). Packed isopycnals across a front imply strong vertical shear and jets.

### Sverdrup balance and gyres; western intensification
- On a \(\beta\)‑plane, interior meridional transport obeys Sverdrup balance: \( \beta V \approx \mathrm{curl}_z\,\boldsymbol{\tau}/\rho_0 \). Integrating zonally gives subtropical and subpolar gyres forced by wind‑stress curl (negative curl → poleward interior flow in NH subtropical gyres).  
- To close the circulation, a narrow, fast western boundary current returns flow equatorward (NH subtropical gyres) due to planetary vorticity gradients and friction (Stommel/Munk theories). Result: western intensification (Gulf Stream, Kuroshio). Eastern boundary currents (Canary, California) are broad, slow, upwelling‑prone.

### Upwelling and downwelling settings
- Coastal: wind parallel to coast with Ekman transport away from the coast (offshore in surface layer) → upwelling; onshore transport → downwelling.  
- Equatorial: trades cause divergence across the equator (opposite Ekman directions in each hemisphere) → equatorial upwelling.  
- Wind‑stress curl: positive curl (NH) induces Ekman suction (upwelling) in gyre interiors; negative curl induces Ekman pumping (downwelling).

### Quick station applications
- From wind vectors, sketch Ekman transport arrows, diagnose upwelling/downwelling, and predict SST/chlorophyll response.  
- From an SSH map, draw geostrophic currents, identify western intensification, and mark eddies as closed highs/lows with clockwise/counterclockwise rotation by hemisphere.  
- Given \(\tau_x(y)\), compute \(\mathrm{curl}\,\boldsymbol{\tau} = \partial\tau_y/\partial x - \partial\tau_x/\partial y\) and estimate \(w_E\) sign and relative magnitude.


## Deep Circulation (Thermohaline/MOC) and Water Masses
The Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) links surface buoyancy forcing (heat and freshwater) to abyssal flows. Dense waters form at high latitudes, sink, spread along isopycnals, and are returned to the surface by a combination of wind‑driven upwelling in the Southern Ocean and diapycnal mixing in the ocean interior. Identifying water masses and their pathways is a core skill.

### Overturning structure (cells and basins)
- Atlantic: a prominent upper cell features northward surface flow, deep water formation in the subpolar North Atlantic/Labrador and Nordic Seas, and southward export of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) at ~2–4 km depth; a lower cell involves Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) intruding northward beneath NADW.  
- Indo‑Pacific: weak deep water formation; abyss is filled primarily by AABW from the Antarctic margins, with slow return via mixing and upwelling.  
- Southern Ocean: winds and eddies set a global “gateway” where deep waters are upwelled along isopycnals in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), transformed by air–sea fluxes, and subducted as mode and intermediate waters.

### Formation regions and characteristics (qualitative ranges)
- NADW: formed by strong winter cooling and sea‑ice processes increasing density of North Atlantic surface waters; typically Θ ≈ 2–4°C, S ≈ 34.8–35.0, relatively high O₂ and low nutrients compared with older deep waters.  
- AABW: extremely dense shelf waters around Antarctica (brine rejection in sea‑ice formation) mix and sink downslope; Θ ≲ 0°C to −0.5°C, S ≈ 34.6–34.7; very cold, relatively fresh for deep waters.  
- Mode and Intermediate Waters (SAMW/AAIW): subducted north of the ACC where winter mixed layers are deep; AAIW shows a salinity minimum at intermediate depths (e.g., S ≈ 34.2–34.6, Θ ≈ 3–7°C).  
- Marginal Sea Overflows: Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) and Red Sea/Persian Gulf Waters are warm and very salty; they descend to intermediate depths and spread as distinct salinity maxima in T–S space.

### Pathways and topographic steering
- Western boundary currents at depth: deep western boundary currents (DWBCs) export NADW southward along continental slopes; abyssal flows follow isobaths and fracture zone corridors.  
- ACC and fronts: circumpolar jets guide water‑mass transformation and exchange among basins; cross‑frontal exchange is eddy‑mediated.  
- Sills, ridges, and trenches choke and channel flows, setting distinct property steps (e.g., through the Vema Channel in the South Atlantic). Topography and bottom‑intensified mixing create along‑slope biases.

### Mixing, upwelling, and energy sources (conceptual)
- Isopycnal vs diapycnal: property exchange is strong along isopycnals (stirring by mesoscale eddies), weak across them (diapycnal). Interior upwelling of dense waters requires diapycnal mixing.  
- Energy: breaking internal tides (generated where barotropic tides impinge on rough topography) and lee waves (over rough bottom under strong currents) supply much of the power for abyssal mixing. Enhanced near boundaries and rough bathymetry; weak in stratified abyssal interiors.

### Tracers and ventilation age
- Transient tracers: CFC‑11/12 and SF₆ enter the ocean from the atmosphere with known time histories; elevated concentrations mark recently ventilated waters (decades).  
- Radiocarbon (Δ¹⁴C): decays with a 5730‑yr half‑life and records older ages (centuries to millennia).  
- AOU and nutrients: high AOU and high nitrate/phosphate indicate long isolation and cumulative respiration; low AOU/high O₂ indicates youth. Combine tracers to infer relative ages and pathways (e.g., North Atlantic vs North Pacific deep waters).

### Identifying water masses on T–S–O₂ diagrams
- Use potential density referenced appropriately (σ₀ near surface/thermocline, σ₂/σ₄ for deep/abyss) to avoid compressibility artifacts.  
- End‑member fingerprints: NADW (higher salinity at a given potential temperature, higher O₂, lower nutrients), AABW (coldest, relatively fresh), AAIW (intermediate salinity minima), MOW (salinity maximum).  
- Mixing lines: property pairs fall on near‑linear segments connecting source end‑members; curvature suggests non‑linear effects or multiple mixing sources.

### Overturning diagnostics (qualitative)
- Meridional overturning streamfunction: zonally integrated transport in density or depth coordinates visualizes cells (no calculation required unless data provided).  
- Section methods: geostrophic shear from thermal wind plus a reference velocity (e.g., lowered ADCP or level of no motion assumption) yields absolute velocities and transports. For contest settings, interpret shear direction from isopycnal tilts and discuss likely reference choices.

### Worked reasoning examples
- A deep Atlantic section shows a salinity maximum at ~1000–1500 m and high O₂; below ~3000 m, temperature and salinity decrease further. Interpretation: overlying NADW core with young ventilation; underlying colder AABW intruding northward along the bottom.  
- A Pacific section shows very low O₂ at ~1000 m (OMZ) and high nutrients; deep waters below 3000 m are cold and have low O₂ relative to the Atlantic—consistent with older deep waters ventilated from the Southern Ocean with long interior pathways.

### Quick station applications
- From co‑located T–S–O₂ profiles, label NADW, AAIW, and AABW layers and draw mixing arrows.  
- On a bathymetric transect with property sections, infer where DWBCs would hug the slope and where sills constrain water‑mass exchange.  
- Given tracer maps (CFCs or Δ¹⁴C) and O₂, rank water masses by relative age and justify using at least two tracers.


## Surface Gravity Waves (Expanded)
Surface wind waves are dispersive gravity waves whose properties evolve with depth, bathymetry, and wind forcing.

Key descriptors
- Height H (trough to crest), period T, wavelength L, celerity C = L/T, direction θ. Significant wave height Hs ≈ mean of highest one‑third of waves; energy scales with H².

Dispersion relation and regimes
- Linear deep‑water: \( \omega^2 = gk \), so \( C = \omega/k = \sqrt{g/k} = gT/(2\pi) \). Longer‑period waves travel faster; swell separates by period.
- Shallow‑water: \( \omega^2 = gkd \Rightarrow C = \sqrt{gd} \) (non‑dispersive, independent of period).  
- Intermediate depths use \( \omega^2 = gk\tanh(kd) \). Know limits and apply given depth.

Group velocity and energy
- Energy density per unit surface area: \( E = \frac{1}{8}\,\rho g H^2 \).  
- Group speed \( C_g \) carries energy: deep water \( C_g = C/2 \); shallow water \( C_g = C \).  
- Energy flux (wave power per crest length): \( P = E\,C_g \). As waves shoal, \(C_g\) decreases so H increases to conserve flux (neglecting breaking and friction).

Shoaling and refraction
- Shoaling coefficient \( K_s \approx \sqrt{C_{g0}/C_g} \) (0: deep reference).  
- Refraction (Snell’s law): \( \frac{\sin\theta}{C} = \text{constant} \) along a ray; waves turn to align with depth contours. Focusing on headlands, defocusing in embayments explains spatial patterns of H.

Breaking and surf zone
- Breaking onset when steepness exceeds a limit: deep‑water criterion \( H/L \gtrsim 0.14 \); shallow‑water depth‑limited criterion \( H_b/d_b \approx 0.78 \).  
- Breaker type depends on beach slope and wave conditions: spilling (gentle slopes, gradual energy dissipation) vs plunging (steeper slopes, strong turbulence).  
- Wave setup (elevated mean water level in surf zone) and setdown (seaward) arise from radiation stress gradients.

Wave–current interaction
- Currents Doppler‑shift frequency and can steepen waves opposing flow, enhancing breaking (e.g., at river mouths). Effective depth decreases in opposing currents, increasing refraction.

Generation and spectra (qualitative)
- Wind input depends on fetch, duration, and wind speed. Fully developed seas approach Pierson–Moskowitz spectra; growing seas often follow JONSWAP with peakedness. Far‑field swell is low‑loss and organizes by period.

Tsunamis and long waves
- Generated by seafloor displacements/landslides; behave as shallow‑water waves (C = √(gd)) across the ocean, weakly attenuated, with long periods (minutes). Coastal amplification depends on shelf geometry, harbor resonance, and run‑up dynamics.

Worked examples
- Deep‑water celerity: T = 12 s ⇒ \( C \approx gT/(2\pi) \approx 9.81\times12/6.283 \approx 18.7\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-1}} \).  
- Shallow‑water celerity: d = 10 m ⇒ \( C \approx \sqrt{9.81\times10} \approx 9.9\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-1}} \).  
- Depth‑limited breaking: at d = 3 m, \( H_b \approx 0.78\,d \approx 2.3\,\mathrm{m} \).

Quick station applications
- Given contours, draw wave rays, identify focusing/defocusing, and estimate relative H via \(K_s\).  
- From offshore H,T and shelf depth, estimate nearshore breaking height and argue breaker type from slope.

## Tides (Expanded)
Tides are forced oscillations by the Moon and Sun filtered by basin geometry and Earth’s rotation.

Constituents and types
- Principal constituents: M2 (lunar semidiurnal), S2 (solar semidiurnal), K1 and O1 (diurnal). Diurnal, semidiurnal, and mixed regimes result from relative amplitudes/phases of constituents. Spring tides (larger range) occur at syzygy; neap tides (smaller) at quadrature.

Equilibrium vs dynamic tides (conceptual)
- Equilibrium theory gives broad latitudinal patterns and periods but ignores continents; dynamic tide theory includes propagation as shallow‑water waves with Coriolis, leading to amphidromic systems—rotary standing waves around nodes with cotidal lines.

Resonance and amplification
- Basin/estuary natural periods \( T_n \sim 2L/\sqrt{gd} \) (quarter‑wave) can amplify tides when near constituent periods. Narrow inlets, shelf geometry, and friction control Q‑factor and amplification.

Tidal currents and mixing
- Flood and ebb currents accompany sea‑level oscillations; maxima typically occur near mid‑tide. In straits/headlands, strong tidal jets and internal tide generation drive mixing; baroclinic tides propagate and break over rough topography enhancing diapycnal mixing.

Harmonic analysis (qualitative)
- Observed tides are fit as sums of sinusoids at known frequencies. Knowing which constituents dominate aids interpretation of tide tables and current predictions in problems.

Quick station applications
- From a cotidal chart, infer rotation sense (counterclockwise/clockwise) around amphidromes by hemisphere and identify regions of large tidal range.  
- Use depth and estuary length to discuss resonance potential and where tidal mixing would be strongest.

## Coastal Processes and Morphodynamics (Expanded)
Coastlines evolve under waves, currents, river sediment supply, storms, and sea‑level change.

Longshore transport and shoreline change
- Wave angle at breaking drives alongshore currents and sand transport. Conceptually, transport rate scales with \( H_b^{5/2}\,\sin(2\alpha_b) \) (CERC‑type), where \(H_b\) is breaking height and \(\alpha_b\) is breaker angle relative to shore‑normal. Groins/jetties interrupt flux and cause updrift accretion, downdrift erosion.

Cross‑shore exchange and profiles
- Beach profiles adjust seasonally: storm (barred, flatter) vs fair‑weather (bermed, steeper). Idealized Dean profile \( h(y) = A y^{2/3} \) captures equilibrium trends; parameter A increases with sediment size (coarser → steeper).  
- Rip currents: feeder currents converge to narrow seaward jets through breaks in bars; enhanced under longshore non‑uniformity and heavy surf.

Barrier islands and inlets
- Barrier islands migrate landward under sea‑level rise by overwash and inlet processes (“rollover”). Inlet dynamics set ebb/flood tide deltas and adjacent shoreline change; engineered stabilization (jetties) trades navigational reliability against downdrift impacts.

Deltas and estuaries (morphodynamic view)
- Deltas reflect river‑, wave‑, or tide‑dominated regimes (Galloway triangle). Lobes prograde where sediment supply exceeds reworking; switching redistributes growth. Estuary types (rias, fjords, bar‑built, deltaic) tie geometry to mixing and residence times.

Sea‑level rise, surge, and hazards
- Relative sea‑level change combines eustatic rise, vertical land motion, and sediment compaction. The Bruun concept (conceptual only) suggests shoreline retreat scales with the need to maintain profile shape; in reality, controls are site‑specific.  
- Storm surge drivers: wind setup, pressure deficit (≈1 cm per hPa), wave setup, and tide phase. Compound flooding occurs where river discharge co‑occurs with surge.

Coastal landforms and identification
- Erosional: sea cliffs, wave‑cut platforms, sea stacks/arches. Depositional: beaches, spits, tombolos, barrier islands, dunes, lagoons, tidal flats, deltas, estuaries. Link landforms to dominant processes and sediment sources.

Quick station applications
- From aerial imagery, infer net longshore transport from spit orientation and updrift/downdrift morphology.  
- Given offshore H,T and slope, estimate breaking H and reason about rip current risk and breaker type.  
- On a delta map, classify regime (river/wave/tide) and predict channel/mouth bar evolution.

## Seafloor Topography and Continental Margins (Expanded)
Bathymetry mirrors plate setting and sedimentary processes. Recognize these signatures rapidly on shaded relief and profiles.

### Continental margins
- Passive (Atlantic-type): broad shelves (10–200+ km), gentle slopes, thick sediment wedges forming the rise; abundant submarine canyons and large deep-sea fans. Shelf break ~120–200 m.  
- Active (Pacific-type): narrow shelves, steep slopes, trenches adjacent to volcanic arcs; accretionary prisms at many subduction zones; forearc basins common.

### Ocean basins
- Abyssal plains (flat, low relief), draped by pelagic sediments; thickness increases away from ridges. Seamounts and guyots (flat-topped former islands) punctuate basins; guyot planation records paleo-sea levels and subsidence.  
- Mid-ocean ridges: divergent boundaries with axial highs/valleys, high heat flow, hydrothermal vents; symmetric magnetic stripes record spreading and polarity reversals.  
- Fracture zones/transform faults: offset ridge segments; transforms are active strike-slip; long fracture zones are fossil topographic scars.  
- Trenches: deepest linear depressions at subduction zones; paired with forearc ridges; back-arc basins may open in some settings.

### Processes
- Turbidity currents: gravity-driven sediment flows depositing graded turbidites that build rises/fans.  
- Contour currents: along-slope bottom currents sculpt drifts and moats.  
- Hydrothermal circulation: alteration of crustal rocks and metalliferous deposits near ridges.  
- Carbonate compensation depth (CCD): depth below which CaCO₃ dissolves faster than it accumulates; controls carbonate preservation.

### Identification tips
- Passive margins: wide shelves, canyon networks, large fans (e.g., Bengal).  
- Active margins: narrow shelves, trench + arc pair, accretionary wedges.  
- Ridges: linear highs with axial rifts; symmetric anomalies.  
- Trenches: narrow deeps parallel to arcs.  
- Abyssal plains: broad smooth expanses between rises/ridges.  
- Seamount chains: age-progressive hotspot tracks vs scattered fields.

## Observing Systems and Tools
Oceanography relies on complementary platforms that sample different scales. Know what each measures, its strengths/limits, and how to interpret typical outputs.

### In situ hydrography: CTD and bottles
- CTD (Conductivity–Temperature–Depth): continuous vertical profiles of T, S (via conductivity), pressure, and often O₂, fluorescence, turbidity. Outputs: sharp thermoclines/pycnoclines, oxygen minima, chlorophyll maxima.  
- Niskin bottles: discrete water samples for lab analyses (nutrients, dissolved oxygen via Winkler, DIC/Alk, isotopes); calibrate sensors and build nutrient/oxygen profiles to compare with T–S.

### Moored arrays and time series
- Moorings: fixed‑point records of currents (ADCP), T/S at multiple depths, pressure, O₂, pH. Resolve tides, internal waves, mixing events, seasonal cycles; limited spatial coverage.  
- Coastal HF radar: maps surface currents over broad coastal domains; excellent for resolving upwelling jets/eddies.

### Lagrangian platforms
- Surface drifters: follow near‑surface currents; provide SST and velocity; used to infer Ekman/slip components and mixed layer advection.  
- Profiling floats (Argo): global array profiling to ~2000 m every ~10 days, measuring T/S (and biogeochemical sensors on BGC‑Argo: O₂, nitrate, pH, backscatter, chlorophyll). Provide climatological T–S–O₂ fields and water‑mass evolution.

### Shipboard and autonomous vehicles
- Ship ADCP (SADCP) and lowered ADCP (LADCP): velocity profiles underway and on stations; combine with hydrography for absolute geostrophic currents.  
- Gliders: autonomous vehicles profiling T/S/O₂/chl along repeat transects; excellent for resolving coastal fronts, upwelling filaments, and internal tide signatures at high resolution.

### Remote sensing (satellites)
- SSH/Altimetry: sea level anomalies map geostrophic currents and eddies (length scales ~50–200 km).  
- SST: skin temperature patterns identify fronts and upwelling plumes; combine with winds to diagnose Ekman processes.  
- Ocean color (chlorophyll): proxy for phytoplankton biomass; co‑located with upwelling, eddies, and river plumes; surface‑biased and light‑limited.  
- Scatterometry: surface wind vectors over the ocean; critical for Ekman transport and curl diagnostics.  
- SAR and optical imagery: submesoscale fronts, internal wave packets, slicks; qualitative but insightful.  
- Sea‑ice concentration/extent: passive microwave for polar processes and brine rejection context.

### Geological tools
- Multibeam and side‑scan sonar: high‑resolution bathymetry and backscatter for seafloor type and morphology.  
- Cores and dredges: sediment stratigraphy and paleo records (microfossils, isotopes) to reconstruct past ocean/climate states.  
- Seismic reflection: sub‑bottom structure, turbidite layers, fluid pathways; ties tectonics to basin evolution.

### Quick station applications
- Given a CTD cast with O₂ and fluorescence, locate the chlorophyll maximum, OMZ, MLD, and nutricline; explain physical controls.  
- From simultaneous altimetry and SST maps, identify eddies and fronts, then hypothesize chlorophyll response; propose an Argo/glider sampling strategy.  
- With a mooring time series, separate tidal, near‑inertial, and seasonal bands; link events to wind forcing.

## Ocean Chemistry: Nutrients, Oxygen, Redox, and the Biological Pump
Ocean chemistry links physics to ecology. Nutrients and oxygen exhibit systematic vertical and horizontal patterns that reflect circulation (ventilation and upwelling), biological uptake and remineralization, and redox processes. Mastering these patterns lets you infer production, remineralization, and ventilation age from simple profiles and sections.

### Nutrient inventory, stoichiometry, and patterns
- Macronutrients: nitrate (NO₃⁻), phosphate (PO₄³⁻), and silicic acid (Si(OH)₄) limit primary production regionally; ammonium (NH₄⁺) is a reduced, readily assimilable N form regenerated locally.  
- Micronutrients: iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), cobalt (Co) can limit growth in High‑Nutrient, Low‑Chlorophyll (HNLC) regions (eastern equatorial Pacific, subarctic Pacific, Southern Ocean). Iron sources include dust, upwelling, margin sediments, and hydrothermal inputs.

Redfield stoichiometry and variants
- Canonical Redfield ratio for soft tissue: C:N:P ≈ 106:16:1 by moles. Oxygen changes accompany organic matter oxidation: −O₂:C ≈ −138:106 (≈ −1.3 mol O₂ per mol C). Diatoms additionally require Si in roughly Si:N ≈ 1:1 to 2:1 depending on conditions.  
- Deviations (regional “non‑Redfield”) occur; use given stoichiometry in problems if provided, else default to Redfield for qualitative reasoning.

Vertical structure (typical open‑ocean profiles)
- Surface: nutrients near depletion due to rapid biological uptake; a shallow nutricline often coincides with or lies below the thermocline.  
- Below euphotic zone: nutrients increase with depth as sinking organic matter is remineralized; deep waters carry high “regenerated” nutrients that reflect long isolation from the surface.  
- Lateral patterns: subtropical gyres (oligotrophic, low surface nutrients), eastern boundary upwelling (nutrient‑rich surface), HNLC regions (high surface nutrients but low chlorophyll due to Fe/light/grazing limitations).

N* and P* tracers (qualitative)
- N* ≡ [NO₃⁻] − 16[PO₄³⁻] + 2.9 µmol kg⁻¹ (constant accounts for atmospheric deposition/nitrogen fixation baseline). Positive N* suggests nitrogen fixation (adds N relative to P); negative N* suggests denitrification/anammox (removes fixed N).  
- P* analogs highlight regions exporting phosphate anomalies; use qualitatively when such definitions are supplied.

### Remineralization and export production
- Export production and e‑ratio: new production (supported by external nutrients like nitrate) exported as sinking particulate organic carbon (POC). The e‑ratio (export/primary production) ranges from ≈0.1–0.5, higher in high‑latitude and upwelling regions, lower in subtropical gyres.  
- Flux attenuation (Martin curve): POC flux with depth often follows \(F(z) = F_{100}\,(z/100\,\mathrm{m})^{-b}\) with b ≈ 0.8–1.4; higher b (stronger attenuation) in warm, oligotrophic waters; lower b (deeper penetration) in cooler, productive regions with denser particles and mineral ballast (CaCO₃, opal, lithogenics).  
- DOM vs POM and the microbial loop: a large fraction of primary production is transformed into dissolved organic matter (DOM) and recycled by bacteria and micrograzers, retaining nutrients in the euphotic zone. Sinking POM is the main vehicle of deep nutrient regeneration and carbon sequestration.

Worked reasoning (export)
- If primary production is 800 mg C m⁻² d⁻¹ and export at 100 m is 200 mg C m⁻² d⁻¹, e‑ratio = 0.25. With b = 1.0, export at 1000 m is ≈ 200 × (1000/100)⁻¹ = 20 mg C m⁻² d⁻¹.

### Oxygen: sources, sinks, and patterns
- Sources: air–sea gas exchange (solubility increases in cold, fresh water and under higher pressure; decreases with warming and salinity) and photosynthesis in the euphotic zone.  
- Sinks: respiration (aerobic oxidation of organic matter), nitrification, and chemoautotrophic processes below the euphotic zone. Daily cycles can cause near‑surface supersaturation by photosynthesis and wave breaking.  
- Apparent Oxygen Utilization (AOU) = O₂* − O₂, where O₂* is saturation at in‑situ T, S, and p. Large AOU implies substantial respiration since last surface equilibration (older or more biologically processed water).  
- Typical profiles: near‑surface values close to saturation or supersaturated during daylight; an oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) at thermocline/intermediate depths where respiration exceeds supply; deeper waters may have higher O₂ if recently ventilated (e.g., North Atlantic Deep Water) and lower O₂ in older waters (North Pacific Deep Water).

Redox ladder and low‑oxygen processes (qualitative)
- As O₂ drops, microbes use alternative electron acceptors in sequence: nitrate (denitrification/anammox), manganese(IV), iron(III), sulfate (sulfate reduction), and finally CO₂ (methanogenesis) in sediments. In pelagic OMZs, denitrification/anammox are key, reducing fixed nitrogen inventory and depressing N*.

### Biological, soft‑tissue, and carbonate pumps (overview)
- Soft‑tissue pump: conversion of DIC and nutrients into organic matter at the surface and remineralization at depth creates vertical gradients—low nutrients/O₂ high at surface; high nutrients/low O₂ at depth. The strength depends on export magnitude and remineralization depth.  
- Carbonate pump: formation of CaCO₃ shells at the surface reduces alkalinity (Alk) and increases surface pCO₂ relative to soft‑tissue drawdown; sinking/dissolution at depth restores Alk and DIC, setting the vertical DIC/Alk structure. The lysocline/CCD mark depths where CaCO₃ dissolution accelerates. Full carbonate system chemistry (DIC, Alk, pH, pCO₂) is covered in a later stage; here, know that calcification can locally raise CO₂ despite organic carbon export.

### Quick station applications
- From co‑located T, S, O₂, and NO₃ profiles, identify: mixed layer, nutricline depth, OMZ, and whether deep water is young (high O₂, low AOU) or old (low O₂, high AOU).  
- Given surface NO₃ ≈ 0 and strong upwelling indicators (cold SST, favorable winds), infer high new production and possible diatom dominance if Si is ample.  
- Using two‑depth POC fluxes, estimate b in the Martin curve and discuss how temperature and mineral ballast could change it.  
- Interpret an HNLC map: high NO₃ but low chlorophyll where Fe limitation and deep mixed layers limit blooms; predict response to dust/Fe pulses.

## Climate Variability and Teleconnections (Expanded)
Large‑scale ocean–atmosphere modes organize interannual to multidecadal fluctuations in winds, SST, thermocline depth, and ecosystems.

### ENSO dynamics
- Bjerknes feedback: initial eastern Pacific warming weakens trades → reduces upwelling and flattens thermocline tilt → further eastern warming. Opposite for La Niña.  
- Equatorial waves: westerly wind bursts generate downwelling Kelvin waves that propagate east along the equator, deepening the thermocline and preconditioning El Niño; reflected Rossby waves and off‑equatorial adjustments modulate phase transitions.  
- Recharge–discharge (conceptual): warm water volume anomalies build in the west (recharge) then spread east during El Niño (discharge), altering the mean state and setting up the next phase.

Phenomenology and impacts
- El Niño: eastward shift of convection, weakened Walker circulation, suppressed Peruvian upwelling, and rainfall/temperature teleconnections via planetary waves; increased Eastern Pacific hurricanes and decreased Atlantic activity (on average).  
- La Niña: strengthened trades, enhanced upwelling/thermocline tilt, opposite SST and rainfall anomalies; regional drought/flood shifts.  
- Indices: ONI (Niño‑3.4 SST anomaly), SOI (Tahiti–Darwin pressure), Niño‑1+2/3/4 regions. Use indices qualitatively to classify events and compare impacts.

### Other modes (qualitative)
- PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation): decadal SST pattern resembling ENSO’s footprint but with distinct dynamics and persistence; modulates ENSO impacts.  
- AMO (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation): basin‑wide North Atlantic SST variability linked to MOC and surface fluxes; correlates with hurricane activity and rainfall patterns.  
- IOD (Indian Ocean Dipole): zonal SST gradient in the Indian Ocean tied to monsoon variability; positive IOD brings anomalous cooling in the east and warming in the west, affecting rainfall.  
- SAM/NAO (Southern/North Annular Modes): atmospheric pressure oscillations shifting westerly wind belts and storm tracks; affect upwelling and ACC fronts (SAM) and North Atlantic winds (NAO).

### Quick station applications
- From a Hovmöller diagram of equatorial thermocline depth, identify Kelvin wave passages and link them to wind anomalies; infer developing El Niño/La Niña.  
- Given SST anomaly maps and wind vectors, classify the ENSO phase and predict coastal upwelling anomalies off Peru/California.  
- Compare chlorophyll anomaly composites between El Niño and La Niña in EBUS to infer productivity shifts.

## Fisheries and Biophysical Links
Physical variability structures marine ecosystems. Upwelling, stratification, and circulation control nutrients, light, and retention—key to recruitment and fishery yields.

Eastern boundary upwelling systems (EBUS)
- Canary, California, Humboldt (Peru–Chile), and Benguela: strong wind‑driven upwelling, fronts, and filaments. Productivity hinges on favorable winds and retention zones (upwelling shadows); too strong winds can export larvae offshore, reducing recruitment.

Sardine–anchovy alternations (conceptual)
- Regime shifts on decadal scales correlate with basin modes (PDO) and upwelling structure: sardines favor warmer, stratified conditions with broader habitat; anchovies favor cooler, more nutrient‑rich conditions with stronger upwelling and shorter food chains. These are probabilistic tendencies, not deterministic rules.

ENSO impacts
- El Niño suppresses coastal upwelling and deepens the thermocline in the east Pacific, reducing nutrients and shifting species distributions poleward/deeper; La Niña enhances upwelling and can boost productivity, modulated by wind stress and mesoscale retention. Hypoxia can expand with strong stratification and low O₂ intrusions from the OMZ.

Habitat and transport
- Larval retention in embayments and behind headlands (retention zones) improves recruitment; eddies and fronts act as transport corridors or barriers. River plumes create productive fronts but can limit salinity‑tolerant species.

Quick station applications
- With wind stress and SST/chlorophyll maps for an EBUS, infer expected fishery productivity anomalies and discuss retention/export mechanisms.  
- From a time series of upwelling indices and catch data, reason about lagged correlations and confounders (effort, management).  
- Given a frontal map with eddies and a spawning ground, sketch likely larval pathways and retention hotspots.

## Quantitative Skills and Scaling (Expanded)
Competitions reward clean set‑ups, correct units, and back‑of‑envelope checks. Use standard forms and state assumptions.

### Units, constants, and conversions
- g ≈ 9.81 m s⁻²; ρ₀ ≈ 1025 kg m⁻³ (seawater); f ≈ 10⁻⁴ s⁻¹ at 45° (scale); 1 PW = 10¹⁵ W.  
- 1 dbar ≈ 1 m depth; 1 Sv = 10⁶ m³ s⁻¹; 1 hPa ≈ 1 mbar ≈ 100 Pa.  
- Stress τ in N m⁻²; velocities in m s⁻¹; transports in m² s⁻¹ per meter width (or Sv for integrated flows).

### Core relationships (remember forms and signs)
- Geostrophic surface current from SSH slope: \( \mathbf{u}_g = (g/f)\,\mathbf{k}\times\nabla\eta \).  
- Ekman transport: \( \mathbf{M}_E = (\mathbf{k}\times\boldsymbol{\tau})/(\rho_0 f) \); Ekman pumping: \( w_E \approx (\mathrm{curl}_z\,\boldsymbol{\tau})/(\rho_0 f) \).  
- Shallow‑water wave speed: \( C = \sqrt{g d} \); deep‑water: \( C = gT/(2\pi) \).  
- Depth‑limited breaking: \( H_b \approx 0.78\,d_b \).  
- Heat tendency (mixed layer): \( dT/dt \approx Q_{net}/(\rho c_p h) \).  
- Residence time: \( \tau \approx V/Q_{out} \) (state what Q includes: rivers + exchange).  
- Density change (linearized): \( \Delta\rho \approx -\rho_0\,\alpha\,\Delta T + \rho_0\,\beta\,\Delta S \) (use given α,β or reason qualitatively).

### Scaling and nondimensional numbers (qualitative)
- Rossby number \(Ro = U/(fL)\): small Ro → geostrophic balance; large Ro → inertia/waves important (e.g., surf zone).  
- Froude number \(Fr = U/\sqrt{g'H}\) (reduced gravity g′): subcritical/supercritical exchange in straits/estuaries.  
- Rossby radius \(R = \sqrt{g' H}/|f|\): sets mesoscale length; fronts/eddies have O(R) widths (hundreds of km mid‑latitudes; smaller at high latitudes, larger near equator).

### Error checking and significant figures
- Keep 2–3 sig figs in intermediate steps; round at the end. Always write units; box the final result with units and direction.

### Quick estimates
- SSH slope 1×10⁻⁶ → \(u_g \sim 0.1\) m s⁻¹ (for f ≈ 10⁻⁴).  
- τ ≈ 0.1 N m⁻² → \(|M_E| \sim 10\) m² s⁻¹ per meter (NH right of wind).  
- d = 10 m → \(C \sim 10\) m s⁻¹; d = 100 m → \(C \sim 31\) m s⁻¹.

## Worked Multi‑step Examples
Concrete, station‑style examples demonstrating set‑up, computation, and interpretation.

### 1) Ekman pumping from wind‑stress curl
Given \(\tau_x(y) = 0.12 - 0.02\,y\) N m⁻² with y in 10⁶ m (northward) and \(\tau_y=0\), \(\rho_0=1025\) kg m⁻³, \(f=10^{-4}\) s⁻¹.  
1. Compute \(\partial\tau_x/\partial y = -0.02\,\mathrm{N\,m^{-2}} / 10^6\,\mathrm{m} = -2.0\times10^{-8}\,\mathrm{N\,m^{-3}}\).  
2. Curl = \(\partial\tau_y/\partial x - \partial\tau_x/\partial y = +2.0\times10^{-8}\).  
3. \( w_E \approx (2.0\times10^{-8})/(1025\times10^{-4}) \approx 2.0\times10^{-8}/0.1025 \approx 1.95\times10^{-7}\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-1}} \) ≈ 17 m day⁻¹ upward (NH positive curl → upwelling).  
Interpretation: meaningful upwelling over days to weeks; expect cooler SST and higher chlorophyll if nutrients are available.

### 2) Geostrophic flow from SSH gradient
SSH drops 0.15 m over 150 km eastward at 30°N (\(f \approx 7.3\times10^{-5}\) s⁻¹).  
Slope = 1.0×10⁻⁶; \(v_g \approx (g/f)\,\partial\eta/\partial x \approx 9.81\times1.0\times10^{-6} / 7.3\times10^{-5} \approx 0.134\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-1}}\) northward. Flow along isobars with higher sea level on the right (NH).

### 3) Shoaling, refraction, and breaking
Offshore: H₀=2.0 m, T=10 s approaching a beach with uniform 1:50 slope from 20 m depth.  
1. Deep‑water C₀ ≈ gT/2π ≈ 15.6 m s⁻¹; group speed Cg₀ ≈ 7.8 m s⁻¹.  
2. At 5 m depth, shallow‑water C ≈ √(gd) ≈ 7.0 m s⁻¹, so \(K_s \approx \sqrt{C_{g0}/C_g} \approx \sqrt{7.8/7.0} \approx 1.05\); H ≈ 2.1 m (ignoring friction).  
3. Breaker height near \(H_b \approx 0.78 d_b\) ⇒ with H ≈ 2.1 m, \(d_b \approx 2.7\) m. On a 1:50 slope, \(x_b \approx 135\) m offshore of the shoreline.

### 4) Estuary residence time (tidal prism method, approximate)
Bay area A = 50 km², mean depth 8 m → volume V = 4.0×10⁸ m³. Tidal range 1.5 m, exchange fraction ε ≈ 0.2 of prism per tide, semidiurnal (2 tides/day).  
Prism P ≈ A×range = 7.5×10⁷ m³; exchanged per tide εP ≈ 1.5×10⁷ m³; per day Q ≈ 3.0×10⁷ m³ d⁻¹.  
Residence time \(\tau \approx V/Q \approx 13.3\) days (order‑of‑magnitude).

### 5) Density and stability check
Parcel cools by 2°C and freshens by 0.1 (psu). With \(\alpha \approx 2.0\times10^{-4}\,\mathrm{K^{-1}}\) and \(\beta \approx 8.0\times10^{-4}\,\mathrm{(psu)^{-1}}\):  
\(\Delta\rho/\rho_0 \approx -\alpha\,\Delta T + \beta\,\Delta S \approx -2\times10^{-4}(-2) + 8\times10^{-4}(0.1) = 4.0\times10^{-4} + 8.0\times10^{-5} = 4.8\times10^{-4}\). Denser by ~0.5 kg m⁻³ → likely sinks relative to surroundings if isolated.

## Quick Reference: Constants, Equations, and Checklists
Use this as a front‑tab summary in your binder.

### Constants and typical values
- g = 9.81 m s⁻²; ρ₀ = 1025 kg m⁻³; cₚ,w ≈ 4.0×10⁶ J m⁻³ K⁻¹; f ≈ 10⁻⁴ s⁻¹ (mid‑lat).  
- Western boundary current speeds O(1 m s⁻¹); interior geostrophic currents O(0.1 m s⁻¹); Ekman transports O(10 m² s⁻¹ per meter for τ~0.1).

### Equations at a glance
- Geostrophic: \(\mathbf{u}_g = (g/f)\,\mathbf{k}\times\nabla\eta\)  
- Ekman transport/pumping: \( \mathbf{M}_E = (\mathbf{k}\times\boldsymbol{\tau})/(\rho_0 f) \), \( w_E = (\mathrm{curl}\,\boldsymbol{\tau})/(\rho_0 f) \)  
- Wave speeds: deep \( C = gT/(2\pi) \); shallow \( C = \sqrt{gd} \)  
- Breaking: \( H_b \approx 0.78 d_b \)  
- Mixed‑layer heat: \( dT/dt = Q_{net}/(\rho c_p h) \)  
- Residence: \( \tau = V/Q \)

### Station triage checklist
1) Identify data type and axes/units.  
2) Write three observations before explanations.  
3) Compute one or two key diagnostics (MLD, slope, C, \(M_E\), \(w_E\)).  
4) Link to mechanism (Ekman, geostrophy, upwelling, density).  
5) State a concise conclusion; note uncertainty and next measurement.

### Common pitfalls
- Mixing up vector directions (e.g., NH Ekman to the right of wind) or SSH slope signs.  
- Ignoring units or using inconsistent salinity/temperature conventions (SP vs SA, in‑situ vs potential).  
- Over‑interpreting sparse maps; not stating assumptions when estimating.


## Calculations and Examples
- Shallow-water wave speed: C ≈ √(g·d). Example: depth 10 m → C ≈ √(9.81×10) ≈ 9.9 m/s.
- Transport: Q = U × A. A 0.5 m/s longshore current in a 3 m-thick nearshore layer across a 20 m width moves ≈ 30 m³/s of water (conceptual for sediment transport context).
- Residence time of a bay: τ ≈ V / Qout; use to infer dilution of pollutants or nutrients.
- Rough density reasoning: colder and saltier water is denser; a water parcel at 2°C and 35.2 PSU will sink relative to 6°C and 34.7 PSU in the same region.

## Map and Data Skills
- Interpret sea surface height and geostrophic current maps; identify western intensification and eddies.
- Use wind vectors to infer Ekman transport direction and likely upwelling/downwelling zones.
- Recognize coastal landforms on imagery and infer longshore transport direction from spit orientation.
- Read tide tables and identify spring vs. neap cycles and mixed vs. semidiurnal regimes.

## Practice Prompts
1. Given wind vectors along a straight coastline in the N. Hemisphere, determine where upwelling will be strongest.
2. A swell with T = 14 s approaches a gently sloping beach. Predict how wave height and celerity change as it shoals.
3. Compare expected nutrient levels during El Niño vs. La Niña off the coast of Peru and explain why.

## Station-Style Practice Sets (Comprehensive)
Use these multi-part sets to rehearse competition workflows. Work quickly, write units, and state assumptions.

### Set A: Wind, Ekman, and Coastal Upwelling
Data: A straight N–S coastline in the Northern Hemisphere. Alongshore winds (toward‑equator negative) at five points: y = [0, 50, 100, 150, 200] km with τ_y = [−0.12, −0.08, −0.05, −0.02, +0.01] N m⁻²; τ_x ≈ 0. f = 10⁻⁴ s⁻¹, ρ₀ = 1025 kg m⁻³. SST map shows a cool tongue centered at y ≈ 60–100 km.
- Tasks: (1) Sketch Ekman transport vectors. (2) Compute sign and relative magnitude of curl τ and w_E by segment. (3) Mark strongest upwelling zone. (4) Predict chlorophyll anomaly ribbon. (5) Explain why SST is coolest downstream of wind maximum.
- Solution outline: Transport right of wind (offshore for equatorward winds) → upwelling. Negative ∂τ_y/∂x ≈ 0, positive −∂τ_x/∂y where τ_x varies (here τ_y varies with y, so curl = −∂τ_x/∂y + ∂τ_y/∂x ≈ ∂τ_y/∂x). Maximum positive gradient between 0–100 km → strongest upwelling and cool SST; biological peak may lag.

### Set B: SSH to Geostrophic Currents and Eddies
Data: SSH contours every 0.05 m show a closed high centered at (x,y) = (150, 200) km and a zonal slope from west (η = 0.35 m) to east (η = 0.15 m) over 200 km. f = 8.7×10⁻⁵ s⁻¹.
- Tasks: (1) Draw geostrophic flow direction around the eddy. (2) Estimate background current speed from the zonal slope. (3) State which side of the jet has higher sea level. (4) Mark likely fronts.
- Solution outline: NH anticyclone rotates clockwise with higher sea level inside. Zonal slope 0.20/200 km → 1×10⁻⁶; speed ≈ g/f × slope ≈ 9.81/8.7e−5×1e−6 ≈ 0.113 m s⁻¹; higher sea level on right of flow.

### Set C: Hydrographic Section and Water-Mass Identification
Data: Section shows Θ–S with a surface mixed layer (Θ ≈ 20–24°C, S ≈ 34.4–35.2), a salinity maximum at 800–1200 m (Θ ≈ 6–10°C, S ≈ 35.3–35.6), a salinity minimum near 900–1200 m in the south (Θ ≈ 4–7°C, S ≈ 34.2–34.6), and cold deep water (Θ ≈ 0–2°C, S ≈ 34.6–34.8).
- Tasks: (1) Label mode water, NADW core, AAIW, and AABW; draw mixing lines. (2) Rank layers by relative age using O₂ (high/low) and AOU. (3) Hypothesize source regions and pathways.
- Solution outline: Salinity max → NADW (young, high O₂). Salinity min at intermediate depths → AAIW. Deep cold layer → AABW (older in Pacific). Mode waters subducted from subtropics.

### Set D: Waves, Refraction, and Breaking
Data: Offshore H₀ = 1.8 m, T = 12 s. Beach slope ~1:80, depth contours bend around a headland.
- Tasks: (1) Compute deep-water C and nearshore shallow-water C at 5 m depth. (2) Use Snell’s law to sketch rays turning toward shallower water. (3) Estimate depth-limited H_b. (4) Identify focusing on headland vs defocusing in bay and predict shoreline erosion hot spots.
- Solution outline: C₀ ≈ gT/2π; C(5 m) ≈ √(gd). H_b ≈ 0.78 d_b. Rays converge on headland → larger H and erosion; diverge in bay → smaller H and deposition.

### Set E: Estuary Classification and Residence Time
Data: Vertical salinity profiles at mouth/mid/head show: (mouth) nearly uniform 30–32; (mid) surface 20 → bottom 30; (head) surface 5 → bottom 25. Tidal prism: A = 35 km², range 1.2 m, ε = 0.25, semidiurnal.
- Tasks: (1) Classify (salt wedge/partially mixed/well mixed). (2) Draw qualitative circulation arrows. (3) Estimate residence time via tidal prism. (4) Discuss hypoxia risk.
- Solution outline: Strong vertical gradient → salt wedge/partially mixed; εP per tide and V = A×mean depth for τ. Bottom hypoxia risk elevated with strong stratification.

## FAQ and Gotchas
- Ekman direction: surface flow ~20–45° to wind; transport 90° (right NH, left SH).  
- Geostrophic direction: in NH, flow with higher sea level on right; SSH contours are streamlines.  
- Deep vs shallow wave formulas: check kd; deep if kd ≳ π, shallow if kd ≲ 0.5.  
- AOU vs O₂: AOU large means more respiration since last surface contact; low O₂ alone can also reflect weak ventilation—use both.  
- OMZ vs anoxia: OMZ is low‑oxygen, not necessarily zero; sulfide smell indicates reducing sediments, not necessarily pelagic anoxia.  
- Upwelling metrics: favorable wind vs wind‑stress curl vs SST—aligning all three strengthens the diagnosis.

## In-depth guide

Ocean circulation is the moving, constantly evolving response of the ocean to wind stress at the surface, buoyancy forcing from heat and freshwater, Earth’s rotation, and bathymetric constraints. In the surface layer, winds impart momentum that is turned by the Coriolis effect, producing an Ekman spiral: each successive depth layer flows progressively more slowly and rotated relative to the layer above, such that the net transport is 90° to the wind (to the right in the Northern Hemisphere). The pattern of trade winds and westerlies sets up gyres with strong, narrow western boundary currents (Gulf Stream, Kuroshio) and broad, slow eastern boundary currents (California, Canary). Western intensification arises because potential vorticity constraints focus return flows along western margins.

Beneath the wind‑mixed layer, geostrophic balance dominates: large‑scale currents flow along contours of sea surface height (or pressure surfaces), where the horizontal pressure gradient is balanced by Coriolis acceleration. Tilted density surfaces (isopycnals) imply thermal wind shear—a vertical shear of horizontal velocity—so fronts mark jets. Along some coasts, alongshore winds produce coastal upwelling by driving Ekman transport offshore; cold, nutrient‑rich water rises, fueling high productivity. The same physics at the equator yields persistent equatorial upwelling where the Coriolis directions straddle the Equator.

The deep overturning circulation connects surface formation regions (North Atlantic, around Antarctica) to the abyss. When surface waters become cold and salty enough, they sink, spreading as water masses (NADW, AABW) traced by temperature–salinity properties and transient tracers. Mixing and topographic interactions slowly return deep waters to the surface, closing the loop on timescales of centuries to millennia. Variations in freshwater input, winds, and sea‑ice can modulate this overturning, with climate implications.

Waves arise from wind, gravity, and in some cases geology (tsunamis). Deep‑water waves disperse with speed proportional to period; as they approach shore, they feel the bottom (depth ≲ L/2), slow and grow in height, refracting to align with bathymetry. Whether a breaker spills or plunges depends on slope and wave steepness. Tides result from the gravitational tides of the Moon and Sun modulated by basin geometry; some basins exhibit amphidromic systems with rotating tidal waves and nodal points of near‑zero amplitude. Superimposed storm surge and tides drive coastal flooding; tidal currents interact with headlands and straits to produce energetic mixing.

Sandy coasts evolve under the competing influences of wave‑driven longshore transport, cross‑shore exchange, and sea‑level change. Groins, jetties, and harbors interrupt littoral drift and can starve downdrift beaches of sand; barrier islands migrate landward under rising sea level by overwash and inlet processes. Deltas balance river sediment input against wave and tidal reworking, producing characteristic morphologies (river‑, wave‑, tide‑dominated) recognizable on imagery.

ENSO reorganizes the tropical Pacific every few years: in El Niño, weakened trades allow warm water to slosh eastward, deepening the thermocline in the east, suppressing upwelling off Peru, and shifting convection and rainfall patterns. La Niña strengthens the normal state. These shifts propagate globally via atmospheric teleconnections, altering storm tracks, drought/flood risks, and even hurricane statistics. Conceptual indices (Niño 3.4 SST) track anomalies; questions often ask for mechanistic links between winds, thermocline tilt, and upwelling, not for algorithmic index details.
