# Dynamic Planet – Oceanography (2026)

## Overview
Ocean circulation links physics, chemistry, and biology across scales—from waves and tides to wind-driven gyres and the global overturning circulation. This section emphasizes properties of seawater, surface and deep circulation, coastal processes, climate modes (ENSO), map/data interpretation, and practical calculations.

## Learning Objectives
- Explain how temperature and salinity control density and stratification; interpret T–S diagrams qualitatively.
- Describe Ekman transport, geostrophic balance, and western intensification of subtropical gyres.
- Distinguish surface- vs. deep-water formation and pathways in the Atlantic and Pacific basins.
- Describe wave characteristics and transformations, and the basics of tides and tidal patterns.
- Interpret coastal features and sediment transport by waves and currents.

## Properties of Seawater and Stratification
- **Salinity** (~35 PSU open ocean) set by evaporation–precipitation, river input, ice formation/melt.
- **Temperature** structure: mixed layer, thermocline, deep isothermal waters; seasonal thermocline in mid-latitudes.
- **Density** increases with salinity, decreases with temperature; stable stratification resists vertical mixing.
- **T–S diagrams**: water masses (e.g., NADW, AABW, AAIW) identified by characteristic T–S ranges and potential density.

## Surface Circulation
- **Wind stress and Ekman spiral**: surface layer deflected ~20–45° (right in N. Hemisphere, left in S. Hemisphere); net Ekman transport is 90° to wind.
- **Gyres**: subtropical gyres (clockwise in N; counterclockwise in S) with western boundary currents (Kuroshio, Gulf Stream) that are narrow, fast, deep due to western intensification; eastern boundary currents (Canary, California) are broad, slow, upwelling-prone.
- **Upwelling/Downwelling**: alongshore winds drive Ekman transport offshore (upwelling, cold nutrient-rich water) or onshore (downwelling); equatorial divergence drives equatorial upwelling.
- **Geostrophic balance**: pressure-gradient force balanced by Coriolis yields currents flowing along sea surface height contours.

## Deep Circulation (Thermohaline/MOC)
- **Water mass formation**: deep and bottom waters form where cooling and brine rejection increase density (e.g., North Atlantic, around Antarctica).
- **Pathways**: NADW flows southward beneath the Gulf Stream; AABW fills abyss, especially in the Pacific and Indian; mixing and upwelling return waters to the surface.
- **Ventilation timescales**: decades to centuries for thermocline; centuries to millennia for abyssal waters.

## Waves and Tides
- **Waves**: characterized by height (H), period (T), wavelength (L), and speed (celerity C). Deep-water waves have C ≈ gT/2π; shallow-water waves have C ≈ √(g·d). Shoaling in shallow water increases height, decreases speed; refraction focuses/defocuses energy on headlands/bays.
- **Breaking**: spilling vs. plunging; controlled by slope and wave steepness (H/L).
- **Tides**: diurnal, semidiurnal, mixed; spring (larger range) vs. neap (smaller range). Amphidromic systems feature rotary standing waves around nodes.

## Coasts and Sediment Transport
- **Longshore drift**: waves approaching at an angle cause longshore currents transporting sand down the coast; spits, barrier islands, and tombolos form by deposition.
- **Erosional features**: sea cliffs, wave-cut platforms, stacks, arches; **depositional**: beaches, dunes, lagoons, deltas, estuaries.
- **Estuaries**: drowned river valleys (rias), fjords, bar-built; circulation types (salt wedge, well-mixed, partially mixed) depend on river flow vs. tides and geometry.

## ENSO and Climate Variability
- **Normal state**: strong trade winds pile warm water in the western Pacific; upwelling off Peru/Equator; Walker circulation strong.
- **El Niño**: weakened trades; warm anomalies shift east; reduced upwelling off Peru; global teleconnections (wet/dry anomalies by region).
- **La Niña**: enhanced trades; stronger upwelling and thermocline tilt; opposite teleconnections to El Niño.
- **Indices**: ONI (Niño3.4 SST), SOI (pressure), PDO/AMO (decadal modes) provide context but are beyond basic scope.

## Calculations and Examples
- Shallow-water wave speed: C ≈ √(g·d). Example: depth 10 m → C ≈ √(9.81×10) ≈ 9.9 m/s.
- Transport: Q = U × A. A 0.5 m/s longshore current in a 3 m-thick nearshore layer across a 20 m width moves ≈ 30 m³/s of water (conceptual for sediment transport context).
- Residence time of a bay: τ ≈ V / Qout; use to infer dilution of pollutants or nutrients.
- Rough density reasoning: colder and saltier water is denser; a water parcel at 2°C and 35.2 PSU will sink relative to 6°C and 34.7 PSU in the same region.

## Map and Data Skills
- Interpret sea surface height and geostrophic current maps; identify western intensification and eddies.
- Use wind vectors to infer Ekman transport direction and likely upwelling/downwelling zones.
- Recognize coastal landforms on imagery and infer longshore transport direction from spit orientation.
- Read tide tables and identify spring vs. neap cycles and mixed vs. semidiurnal regimes.

## Practice Prompts
1. Given wind vectors along a straight coastline in the N. Hemisphere, determine where upwelling will be strongest.
2. A swell with T = 14 s approaches a gently sloping beach. Predict how wave height and celerity change as it shoals.
3. Compare expected nutrient levels during El Niño vs. La Niña off the coast of Peru and explain why.

## In-depth guide

Ocean circulation is the moving, constantly evolving response of the ocean to wind stress at the surface, buoyancy forcing from heat and freshwater, Earth’s rotation, and bathymetric constraints. In the surface layer, winds impart momentum that is turned by the Coriolis effect, producing an Ekman spiral: each successive depth layer flows progressively more slowly and rotated relative to the layer above, such that the net transport is 90° to the wind (to the right in the Northern Hemisphere). The pattern of trade winds and westerlies sets up gyres with strong, narrow western boundary currents (Gulf Stream, Kuroshio) and broad, slow eastern boundary currents (California, Canary). Western intensification arises because potential vorticity constraints focus return flows along western margins.

Beneath the wind‑mixed layer, geostrophic balance dominates: large‑scale currents flow along contours of sea surface height (or pressure surfaces), where the horizontal pressure gradient is balanced by Coriolis acceleration. Tilted density surfaces (isopycnals) imply thermal wind shear—a vertical shear of horizontal velocity—so fronts mark jets. Along some coasts, alongshore winds produce coastal upwelling by driving Ekman transport offshore; cold, nutrient‑rich water rises, fueling high productivity. The same physics at the equator yields persistent equatorial upwelling where the Coriolis directions straddle the Equator.

The deep overturning circulation connects surface formation regions (North Atlantic, around Antarctica) to the abyss. When surface waters become cold and salty enough, they sink, spreading as water masses (NADW, AABW) traced by temperature–salinity properties and transient tracers. Mixing and topographic interactions slowly return deep waters to the surface, closing the loop on timescales of centuries to millennia. Variations in freshwater input, winds, and sea‑ice can modulate this overturning, with climate implications.

Waves arise from wind, gravity, and in some cases geology (tsunamis). Deep‑water waves disperse with speed proportional to period; as they approach shore, they feel the bottom (depth ≲ L/2), slow and grow in height, refracting to align with bathymetry. Whether a breaker spills or plunges depends on slope and wave steepness. Tides result from the gravitational tides of the Moon and Sun modulated by basin geometry; some basins exhibit amphidromic systems with rotating tidal waves and nodal points of near‑zero amplitude. Superimposed storm surge and tides drive coastal flooding; tidal currents interact with headlands and straits to produce energetic mixing.

Sandy coasts evolve under the competing influences of wave‑driven longshore transport, cross‑shore exchange, and sea‑level change. Groins, jetties, and harbors interrupt littoral drift and can starve downdrift beaches of sand; barrier islands migrate landward under rising sea level by overwash and inlet processes. Deltas balance river sediment input against wave and tidal reworking, producing characteristic morphologies (river‑, wave‑, tide‑dominated) recognizable on imagery.

ENSO reorganizes the tropical Pacific every few years: in El Niño, weakened trades allow warm water to slosh eastward, deepening the thermocline in the east, suppressing upwelling off Peru, and shifting convection and rainfall patterns. La Niña strengthens the normal state. These shifts propagate globally via atmospheric teleconnections, altering storm tracks, drought/flood risks, and even hurricane statistics. Conceptual indices (Niño 3.4 SST) track anomalies; questions often ask for mechanistic links between winds, thermocline tilt, and upwelling, not for algorithmic index details.
