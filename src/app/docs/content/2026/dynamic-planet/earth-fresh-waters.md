## Overview
Comprehensive hydrology across surface and subsurface waters: drainage basins and river systems, lake dynamics and mixing regimes, groundwater flow and storage, sediment transport, floods, deltas, and human impacts on water quantity and quality. Emphasis on maps, cross-sections, and quantitative reasoning.

## Learning Objectives
- Identify and delineate drainage basins and stream networks on topographic maps.
- Explain river profiles, channel patterns, and floodplain features and how they evolve.
- Interpret hydrographs and predict how land use, dams, and storms alter them.
- Describe lake formation, thermal stratification, seasonal turnover, and mixing regimes.
- Explain groundwater storage and flow, aquifer types, and springs; apply Darcy’s law conceptually.
- Perform basic calculations (discharge, gradient, residence time, simple recurrence intervals).

## Hydrologic Cycle and Watersheds
- **Drainage basin**: land area contributing runoff to a common outlet; bounded by divides.
- **Stream order** (Strahler): headwater streams are order 1; confluence of same order increases order by 1.
- **Base level**: lowest elevation to which a stream can erode (ultimate: sea level; local: lakes, resistant beds).
- **Longitudinal profile**: concave-up curve from steep headwaters to gentle lower reaches; adjusts with uplift, sea-level change, or sediment supply.

## River Morphology and Processes
- **Gradient**: S = Δh / L (elevation drop per channel length). Steeper reaches have higher stream power and coarser sediment.
- **Discharge**: Q = V × A, where V is mean velocity, A is cross-sectional area. Increases downstream as tributaries join.
- **Sediment load**: dissolved, suspended, and bedload. Capacity/competence controlled by discharge and velocity. The Hjulström diagram (conceptual) shows thresholds for erosion, transport, deposition by grain size.
- **Channel patterns**:
  - Straight (rare, often engineered)
  - Meandering: outer bank erosion (cutbank), inner bank deposition (point bar); migration forms oxbow lakes.
  - Braided: multiple shallow bars/channels; forms with high sediment supply, variable discharge, erodible banks.
- **Floodplain features**: natural levees, backswamps, scroll bars, terraces. Avulsions relocate channels on deltas and alluvial plains.

## Hydrographs and Floods
- **Hydrograph**: discharge vs. time at a point. “Flashy” (urban, steep) vs. “subdued” (forested, permeable, wide floodplain).
- **Recurrence interval**: R = (n + 1) / m, where n is number of years of record, m is rank (1 = largest). A “100-year flood” has 1% annual exceedance probability (AEP ≈ 1/R), not a fixed 100-year schedule.
- **Human effects**: urbanization increases peak discharge and shortens lag; dams reduce peaks and trap sediment; levees constrain inundation but may shift risk downstream.

## Deltas and Alluvial Fans
- **Delta types** (conceptual triangle by Galloway):
  - River-dominated (e.g., Mississippi): elongate, bird-foot distributaries; high sediment delivery.
  - Wave-dominated (e.g., Nile): smoother shoreline, reworked mouths.
  - Tide-dominated (e.g., Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna): tidal channels, sand ridges.
- **Alluvial fans**: cone-shaped deposits at mountain fronts where gradient drops; often braided channels.

## Lakes: Formation, Stratification, and Mixing
- **Origins**: glacial (kettle, moraine-dammed), tectonic (rift, pull-apart), volcanic (caldera, maar), fluvial (oxbow), karst (sinkholes), landslide-dammed, coastal (lagoon), artificial (reservoirs).
- **Thermal layers**: epilimnion (warm, mixed), metalimnion/thermocline (steep gradient), hypolimnion (cold, dense). Density of freshwater peaks near 4°C.
- **Mixing regimes**: amictic (no mix), monomictic, dimictic (spring/fall turnover), polymictic, meromictic (permanent stratification in deep basin or saline bottom waters).
- **Lake processes**: seiches (standing waves), eutrophication (nutrient enrichment → algal blooms → hypoxia), clarity/turbidity.
- **Residence time**: τ ≈ Volume / Outflow. Useful for pollutant flushing and nutrient budgets.

## Groundwater: Storage and Flow
- **Porosity vs. permeability**: storage vs. ease of flow. Well-sorted sands have high porosity and permeability; clays have high porosity but very low permeability.
- **Aquifers**: unconfined (water table), confined (artesian), perched; confining units (aquitards).
- **Hydraulic head**: elevation + pressure; water flows from high to low head.
- **Darcy’s law** (conceptual): q = −K × (Δh/Δl), where q is specific discharge and K is hydraulic conductivity.
- **Wells and springs**: cones of depression from pumping; drawdown interference; flowing artesian where potentiometric surface is above ground. Karst systems show rapid, conduit-dominated flow.

## Water Quality and Human Impacts
- **Key parameters**: dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), nutrients (N, P), turbidity/total suspended solids, temperature, pH, electrical conductivity/salinity, pathogens (indicator bacteria).
- **Impacts**: nutrient loading → eutrophication; sediment trapping by dams → coastal erosion; channelization → habitat loss; over-extraction → land subsidence; contamination (nitrates, arsenic, PFAS) → health risks.

## Calculations and Examples
- Discharge: Q = V × A. Example: width 12 m, depth 1.5 m, velocity 0.8 m/s → A = 18 m², Q = 14.4 m³/s.
- Gradient: S = Δh / L. Example: drop 40 m over 8 km → S = 0.005 (5 m/km).
- Lake residence time: τ = V / Qout. Example: V = 2.0×10^8 m³, Qout = 20 m³/s → τ ≈ 3.17×10^6 s ≈ 36.7 days.
- Flood recurrence: with 30-year record (n=30) and 3rd largest event (m=3), R = (31/3) ≈ 10.3 years.
- Unit conversions: 1 m³/s ≈ 35.31 cfs; 1 cfs ≈ 0.0283 m³/s.

## Advanced topics (qualitative)
- Channel adjustments to altered flow regimes (urbanization, damming); entrenchment vs aggradation
- Hypolimnetic oxygen depletion in stratified lakes; internal nutrient loading; meromixis persistence
- Karst aquifers: conduit flow, rapid transport, sinkhole hazards; dye tracing

## Map and Data Skills
- Delineate watersheds and identify stream order on topo maps; determine flow direction from V-shaped contour crossings.
- Read and compare hydrographs for land-use impacts and storm response.
- Recognize features on aerial/satellite imagery: meanders, oxbows, levees, deltas, alluvial fans.
- Construct simple cross-sections and estimate channel area and hydraulic radius from surveyed points.

## Practice Prompts
1. A river widens from 10 m to 15 m and deepens from 1.0 m to 1.4 m as it enters a floodplain. If discharge remains 12 m³/s, estimate mean velocity change.
2. Classify a delta with strong longshore currents and smooth shoreline; predict mouth-bar preservation.
3. A pumped well in a confined aquifer causes 6 m of drawdown at 100 m distance. What happens to drawdown if a second identical well is added 200 m away? Explain qualitatively.
4. A dimictic lake experiences prolonged summer warming and mild winters. Predict changes to stratification and turnover.
