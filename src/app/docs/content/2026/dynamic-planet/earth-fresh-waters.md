## Overview
Earth’s fresh waters unite hydrology, geomorphology, and water quality into map‑ and data‑driven diagnosis. Study by learning how drainage networks organize on landscapes, how channels adjust to flow and sediment supply, how lakes stratify and mix, how groundwater moves and stores, and how parameter changes appear in hydrographs and chemistry. Practice converting topographic maps and tables into short, mechanistic explanations.

## Watersheds and rivers in context
Watersheds collect precipitation into streams whose order and profiles reflect underlying geology and climate. Longitudinal profiles tend to be concave‑up because headwaters are steep and downstream reaches flatten; perturbations such as uplift, base‑level change, or altered sediment supply leave knickpoints and terraces. Channel form follows process: meanders migrate by eroding outer banks and depositing on point bars, braided channels form where sediment supply is high and banks are erodible, and floodplains archive overbank and avulsion histories. Hydrographs translate catchment traits and land use into timing and peaks—urban basins respond with flashy, high peaks and short lags, while forested or wetland‑rich basins show subdued responses. Human controls—dams, levees, diversions—rearrange this template, often trading flood peak reduction for sediment deficits and downstream risk transfers.

## Lakes and groundwater
Lakes arise from glacial, tectonic, volcanic, fluvial, karst, landslide, coastal, or engineered origins. Their thermal structure—epilimnion, metalimnion (thermocline), hypolimnion—sets mixing regimes from dimictic turnover in temperate climates to meromixis where dense bottom waters persist. Residence time links volume and outflow to flushing, shaping nutrient budgets and bloom propensity. Below ground, porosity stores water while permeability controls flow; hydraulic head gradients drive movement along paths constrained by stratigraphy. Unconfined aquifers track water tables; confined systems can flow artesian where potentiometric surfaces lie above ground. Pumping produces cones of depression that can interact across wells; karst terrains short‑circuit flow through conduits.

## Quick calculations
- Discharge: Q = V × A (mean velocity times cross‑sectional area)
- Channel gradient: S = Δh/L (elevation drop per length)
- Lake residence: τ ≈ V / Q_out (volume over outflow)
- Flood recurrence: R = (n + 1) / m (record length over rank)

## Water quality and biology
Physical and chemical parameters co‑vary with season and flow. Warm, slow waters with high nutrients favor blooms and nighttime hypoxia; cold, turbulent reaches maintain higher dissolved oxygen. Conductivity rises with ionic inputs from weathering, road salts, or effluent, while turbidity spikes during storms reveal sediment pulses. Biological indicators integrate conditions over time; tolerant taxa dominance suggests stress, while diverse EPT assemblages imply better quality. Interpreting changes requires normalizing by discharge and acknowledging residence times and sources.

## Practice prompts
- Delineate a watershed on a topo map and explain expected hydrograph differences between an urbanized and a forested subbasin after the same storm.
- Given profiles of temperature, DO, and chlorophyll in summer, infer lake mixing regime and risk of hypolimnetic hypoxia.
- Compute discharge and residence time from provided measurements and explain how a dam upstream would alter both.
