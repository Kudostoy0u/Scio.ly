## Overview
Simple machines, power, torque, and mechanical advantage with quantitative and conceptual problems. Emphasis on multi-stage systems, efficiency, and error-aware calculations.

## Core Topics (coverage target)
- Levers (classes I–III), torque balance, moment arms; center of mass
- Pulleys: fixed vs movable; block-and-tackle; compound systems
- Gears: ratios, torque/speed trade-offs; idlers; simple/compound trains
- Wheel/axle, screws, inclined planes, wedges; IMA by geometry
- Efficiency, friction losses; AMA vs IMA; power and energy
- Statics: FBDs, equilibrium, friction cones (qualitative)

## Equations and references
- Torque τ = rF (perpendicular component); Equilibrium Στ=0, ΣF=0
- IMA for ideal systems: e.g., pulleys (count supporting segments), incline IMA ≈ L/H, screw IMA ≈ 2πr/pitch
- Efficiency η = AMA/IMA = (W_out/W_in)
- Gear ratio = driven/driver teeth = ω_driver/ω_driven = τ_driven/τ_driver (ideal)

## Skills
- Compute MA/IMA/AMA and efficiencies; propagate through stages
- Analyze compound pulleys/gears; translate speed to torque and vice versa
- Draw FBDs and solve statics with friction where specified

## Worked examples
1) Pulley: 2-movable + 1-fixed (4 supporting segments) → IMA≈4; with 75% efficiency overall, AMA≈3
2) Gears: Driver 12T → Idler 20T → Driven 60T: overall ratio 60/12=5; idler changes direction only
3) Inclined plane: L=2.5 m, H=0.5 m → IMA=5; with measured force 120 N to lift 500 N load, AMA≈500/120≈4.17; η≈4.17/5≈83%
4) Screw jack: handle radius 0.15 m, pitch 4 mm; IMA≈2πr/p≈2π·0.15/0.004≈235 (ideal)

## Strategy and checks
- Estimate first, then calculate; compare to limiting cases (η→1 ideal)
- Keep units consistent; round at end; show steps for partial credit

## Pitfalls
- Mixing IMA and AMA; ignoring friction when required  
- Sign/direction errors in torque sums; wrong gear tooth ratio orientation

## Practice prompts
- Design a pulley/gear plan to lift a load with max available input force/torque  
- Compute efficiency from measured input/output data and diagnose loss sources
