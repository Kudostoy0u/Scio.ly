## Overview
Foundations of classical and molecular genetics: inheritance patterns, probability, pedigrees, DNA → RNA → protein basics.

## Core Topics
- Mendelian: mono/dihybrid, test crosses, law of segregation/independent assortment
- Extensions: incomplete dominance, codominance, epistasis, multiple alleles
- Sex-linked, mitochondrial, linkage and recombination basics
- Pedigrees: autosomal dominant/recessive, X-linked, matrilineal hints
- Molecular: DNA structure, replication overview, transcription/translation basics

## Calculations
- Probability rules (sum/product), binomial where applicable
- Recombination frequency (intro level if included)

## Strategy
- Build pattern recognition for pedigrees  
- Use probability trees and Punnett shortcuts  
- Keep a concise glossary and phenotype clues

## Worked examples
1) Dihybrid cross (AaBb×AaBb), probability of A−bb: P(A−)=3/4, P(bb)=1/4 → combined 3/16
2) Pedigree: unaffected parents with affected son; no affected daughters across two generations → X-linked recessive likely; verify carriers
3) Conditional probability: given first child is affected, compute probability next is unaffected under autosomal recessive

## Pitfalls
- Misclassifying X-linked vs autosomal  
- Ignoring penetrance/expressivity notes  
- Arithmetic errors in multi-locus problems

## Study Roadmap
1) Master core patterns and exceptions  
2) Timed pedigree sets and crosses  
3) Incorporate molecular basics and vocabulary  
4) Mixed problem sets under time

## Pitfalls
- Misclassifying X-linked vs autosomal  
- Ignoring penetrance/expressivity notes  
- Arithmetic errors in multi-locus problems
