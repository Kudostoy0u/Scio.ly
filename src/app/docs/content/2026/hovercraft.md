# Hovercraft (2026)

Divisions: B, C (Trial in some years)  
Type: Build  
Participants: 2  
Allowed Materials: Device + tools per rules; eye protection; logs/impound as required

## Overview
Construct a small hovercraft within specs to achieve best performance/time. Emphasis on stable lift, efficient thrust, and control.

## Core Topics
- Lift: skirt design, leakage, pressure, weight distribution  
- Propulsion: fan/prop, motor choice, power management  
- Control and straight-line tracking  
- Build tolerances, measurement, impound, run procedure

## Strategy
- Iterate prototypes; maintain engineering logs  
- Optimize mass and skirt materials  
- Practice event-specific course and timing
