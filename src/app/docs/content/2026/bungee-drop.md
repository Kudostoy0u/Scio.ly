# Bungee Drop (2026)

Division: C  
Type: Build/Prediction  
Participants: 2  
Allowed Materials: Device/cord per rules; calculator; safety

## Overview
Predict length of elastic cord to minimize error of drop distance with a given mass.

## Core Topics
- Hooke’s law approximations; damping  
- Curve fitting; calibration tables  
- Uncertainty/error analysis

## Deep dives
- Cord behavior: non-ideal elasticity, hysteresis, temperature effects; multi-segment cords
- Modeling: linear vs quadratic fits; piecewise calibration around target distances
- Error: propagation from length uncertainty to drop error; repeatability metrics

## Calibration and logs
- Record mass, cord length, number of strands, pretension; environment (temp)
- Build lookup tables: target distance → length; include interpolation guidance

## Strategy
- Collect calibration data sets  
- Build quick-reference tables/curves  
- Practice on similar rigs
