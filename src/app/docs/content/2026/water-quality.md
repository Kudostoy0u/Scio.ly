## Overview
Water Quality integrates aquatic chemistry, biology, and watershed processes into data‑driven diagnosis. To study effectively, learn what each parameter means physically, how it varies with season and flow, how biological indicators respond to stress, and how to read plots and tables to explain observed trends. Approach problems by stating observations first, then linking them to mechanisms, and finishing with concise conclusions.

## Parameters and interpretation
Core parameters—dissolved oxygen, temperature, turbidity, conductivity/salinity, pH, and nutrients—interact in predictable ways. Cold, turbulent water holds more oxygen; warm, stagnant water with high nutrient input tends toward algal blooms and hypoxia, particularly at dawn after nighttime respiration. Conductivity rises with dissolved ions such as road salt or wastewater effluent, while turbidity tracks suspended solids from storms or erosion. pH typically sits between 6.5 and 8.5 in freshwaters but shifts with geology, photosynthesis, and acid inputs. Nutrients like nitrate and phosphate drive eutrophication; spikes after storms often presage blooms days later. Interpreting data is often about temporality—diurnal DO swings imply photosynthesis/respiration cycles, while step changes indicate point source inputs or operational events.

## Biological indicators and watersheds
Macroinvertebrate communities offer time‑integrated measures of water quality because taxa differ in tolerance. High EPT richness usually correlates with better conditions, whereas dominance by tolerant midges or worms suggests stress. Place biology in watershed context: land use (urban, agriculture, forest) shapes hydrographs and pollutant loads; riparian buffers moderate temperature and sediment; impoundments alter residence times and stratification; and restoration actions have signatures in both chemistry and community composition. Use maps and simple mass‑balance reasoning to explain elevated loads or depressed oxygen levels at particular sites.

## Worked micro‑examples
- Parameter story: following a summer storm, turbidity and nutrients jump, conductivity spikes, and DO dips briefly before recovering. Two to three days later, chlorophyll increases as the system responds, then early‑morning DO minima deepen due to respiration of added biomass.
- DO range reading: a site with 3–4 mg/L at dawn and 9–10 mg/L in the afternoon shows strong diurnal cycling; shading or flow augmentation could mitigate extremes. Another site with stable ~7–8 mg/L suggests well‑mixed, cooler conditions.
- Load calculation: if nitrate is 5 mg/L and discharge is 20 m³/s, the load is 100 g/s (0.1 kg/s). A downstream site with lower concentration but higher discharge can still carry a greater load—always compute both.

## Pitfalls
Overemphasizing a single parameter without acknowledging flow and season leads to misdiagnosis, as does ignoring units and detection limits. Comparing sites without normalizing for discharge or residence time can invert apparent trends. Biological metrics demand sufficient sample size and season‑appropriate expectations; absence is not always evidence of poor quality if life stages or recent flows explain gaps.

## Practice prompts
- Given diurnal DO and temperature plots over a week, describe biological and physical controls and propose one management action supported by data.
- From paired upstream–downstream datasets across a storm, compute changes in nutrient load and identify likely sources.
- Using a macroinvertebrate table with tolerance values, score sites and relate differences to land use and riparian condition.
