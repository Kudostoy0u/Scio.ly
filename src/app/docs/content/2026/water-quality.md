# Water Quality (2026)

Divisions: B, C  
Type: Hybrid (Study + Data)  
Participants: 2–3  
Approx. Time: 50 minutes  
Allowed Materials: Notes/binder and Class I calculator (confirm rules)

## Overview
Aquatic ecology, limnology, and water chemistry with data interpretation and potential bioindicator identification.

## Core Topics
- Parameters: pH, DO, temperature, turbidity, conductivity, nitrates, phosphates
- Biological Indicators: macroinvertebrates (EPT), algae/cyanobacteria, fish
- Processes: eutrophication, nutrient cycling, dissolved oxygen dynamics
- Watersheds: land use, BMPs, pollution sources, TMDL concepts
- Data: graphs/tables, unit conversions, trend interpretation

## Skills
- Compute parameter-based indices (as permitted)  
- Identify indicator taxa and tolerance  
- Diagnose causes from multi-parameter data

## Study Roadmap
1) Build parameter reference and conversions  
2) Learn indicator taxa with images  
3) Practice multi-parameter data sets  
4) Case studies: remediation strategies

## Parameter quick-reference (qualitative ranges)
- DO: high in cold, turbulent water; low with high temp/eutrophication; consider diurnal cycles
- pH: 6.5–8.5 typical freshwater; acid rain/AMD lower pH; buffers (alkalinity) resist change
- Temperature: controls DO and organism metabolism; shade and depth moderate
- Conductivity/Salinity: increased by dissolved ions; road salt/industrial inputs spike values
- Turbidity/TSS: increases with runoff; affects light penetration and habitat
- Nutrients: nitrates/phosphates from ag/WWTPs → eutrophication; watch seasonal patterns

## Calculations and units
- Conversions: 1 mg/L ~ 1 ppm (freshwater, ~1 g/mL); be explicit when using
- Load = concentration × discharge (consistent units)
- Simple statistics on parameters over time: mean, range; identify outliers linked to storms or point discharges

## Data interpretation walkthrough
- Given seasonal DO minima at dawn and peaks in afternoon → photosynthesis/respiration cycles likely; low-flow periods elevate temperature and depress DO
- After storm: spikes in turbidity and nutrients; short-term DO drop followed by algal bloom days later

## Bioindicators
- EPT richness suggests higher quality; tolerant taxa dominance (e.g., midges) suggests impairment
- Consider life stages and seasonality when interpreting absence/presence
