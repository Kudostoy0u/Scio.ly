# Crime Busters (Division B)

## Overview
Crime Busters is a lab‑based forensic chemistry event. Given a scenario and evidence, students perform qualitative tests and analyze physical evidence to infer plausible conclusions. The emphasis is on systematic observation, safe technique, and clear, defensible reasoning.

## Qualitative analysis (unknowns)
### Common solids (examples)
- Sodium acetate (anhydrous), NaCl, sugar, flour, gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O), cornstarch, baking soda, CaCO3 (powdered limestone), gelatin powder, Alka‑Seltzer® (powdered), sand (white), vitamin C (ascorbic acid), yeast.

Typical cues
- Solubility in water; pH (aqueous); reaction with HCl (carbonates fizz); iodine color (starch → blue/black); heating behavior (sugar caramelizes); effervescence with acids (baking soda). Record consistent multiple traits before concluding.

### Non‑powdered metals
- Al, Fe, Zn, Mg, Cu, Sn. Note magnetism (Fe), color (Cu), reactivity with acids (Mg effervesces strongly), density/appearance.

### Liquids
- Lemon juice, vinegar (acidic); ammonia (basic, pungent), rubbing alcohol (isopropyl, odor, miscibility), water (neutral), hydrogen peroxide (3%). Use odor cautiously per rules, rely on pH and reactions.

## Polymers and natural/man‑made substances
- Hair: human vs common animals (cat, dog). Examine medulla patterns, scale patterns, and diameter under available magnification.
- Fibers: animal vs vegetable vs synthetic; burn results may be provided; look for morphology and simple microscopy traits.
- Plastics: PETE, HDPE, PS (non‑expanded), LDPE, PP, PVC, PMMA. Burn tests are not performed by participants (but results may be provided). Density and other provided diagnostics may be used.

## Paper chromatography
- Separate ink/dye components. Compute Rf = distance solute / distance solvent front. Compare unknown to references under the same solvent conditions. Collect chromatograms with the score sheet when instructed.

## Physical evidence
- Fingerprints: recognize loops, whorls, arches. Note minutiae qualitatively as scope allows.
- DNA chromatograms/electropherograms: compare allele bands/peaks of scene samples to suspects (pattern matching, not population statistics).
- Shoeprints/tire treads: compare patterns and features; infer direction/speed qualitatively.
- Soil: compare composition/texture provided; link plausibly to locations/suspects.
- Spatters: infer direction and relative speed from shape/elongation; no calculations required.

## Analysis and reporting
- Clearly explain which pieces of evidence implicate a suspect and why others are excluded. Tie each conclusion to two or more consistent observations/tests. Note uncertainties and alternative explanations when present.

## Strategy and lab hygiene
- Safety first: goggles on; apron/lab coat; tie back hair; follow supervisor guidance.
- Systematic workflow: one tray per unknown; label containers; fresh sticks/droppers as needed to avoid cross‑contamination.
- Record‑keeping: tabulate tests (reagent, observation, inference); keep a clean bench; dispose of waste properly.
- Time management: prioritize high‑discrimination tests first (e.g., acid fizzing, starch/iodine), then confirmatory tests.

## Quick reference tables
- Carbonates (e.g., CaCO3, NaHCO3): effervescence with acid; CaCO3 less soluble; baking soda basic in solution.
- Starch (cornstarch, flour): blue‑black with iodine; cornstarch finer/talc‑like; flour off‑white and clumps; behavior with water differs.
- Sugars: soluble, sweet odor; caramelize on heating; Benedict’s may appear conceptually (if provided) but is not guaranteed.
- Common plastics (provided data): PVC (chlorinated) vs PP/PE (hydrophobic, low density) vs PMMA (clear, high clarity) — rely on provided clues.

## Practice prompts
1) Given four solids (unknown A–D), design a minimum‑test sequence to identify each using water, 1 M HCl, iodine, and heating. Explain decision points.
2) Compare a suspect’s loop fingerprint to a scene print; state a similarity/difference and whether it supports inclusion.
3) Compute Rf values for two inks and determine a match or mixture.
4) From a DNA electropherogram, identify which suspect pattern matches the scene sample at all loci.

## Common pitfalls
- Cross‑contaminating reagents and unknowns; mislabeling tubes.
- Overreliance on a single ambiguous test; failing to record pH or solubility before reactions.
- Ignoring provided burn results for plastics (participants do not perform burns).
- Concluding guilt from a single matching evidence type without considering alternative suspects.
