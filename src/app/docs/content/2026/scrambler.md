## Overview
Device transports an egg to a target distance quickly and accurately with no breakage.

## Core Topics
- Kinematics; braking; alignment  
- Energy storage (gravity/elastic)  
- Measurement and repeatability

## Deep dives
- Kinematics: stopping distance vs speed; braking profiles; friction coefficient and surface variability
- Energy: gravity drop heights (if used) vs elastic energy; repeatability and temperature effects
- Alignment: track straightness; toe/camber; minimizing scrub

## Calibration and logs
- Build distance calibration curves; test across distances and surfaces
- Record pre-run checks: wheel cleaning, alignment verification, brake reset

## Strategy
- Calibrate for different distances  
- Tune braking systems  
- Practice run procedures and alignment
