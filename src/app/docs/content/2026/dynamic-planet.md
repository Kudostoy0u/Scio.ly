## Overview
Dynamic Planet is most productive when studied as a set of physical principles that recur across topics—seawater and density stratification, wind‑driven and density‑driven circulation, waves and tides, coastal processes, and the geological framework of ocean basins. Use this overview to orient yourself, then dive into the focused pages for the current year’s emphasis.

## Current focus and navigation
This season emphasizes oceanography. Begin with seawater properties and stratification, then connect wind stress and Earth’s rotation to surface circulation and upwelling. Once the physical backbone is clear, add waves, tides, and coastal morphodynamics, and finally tie the physics back to the seafloor’s tectonic setting. For depth, read the dedicated sections:
- Oceanography (properties, circulation, waves/tides, coasts, climate variability)
- Seafloor and tectonics within Oceanography for geological context
- Historical or related topics (Glaciers; Earth’s Fresh Waters) for contrasting stratification and transport problems

## Core relationships (qualitative)
- Geostrophic balance links horizontal pressure gradients to Coriolis so large‑scale currents follow sea‑surface height contours.
- Ekman transport drives a net surface flow 90° to the wind (right in the Northern Hemisphere, left in the Southern Hemisphere), setting coastal upwelling and gyre pumping.
- Simple wave limits bracket behavior: c ≈ gT/2π in deep water and c ≈ √(gd) in shallow water; depth‑limited breaking occurs near Hb ≈ 0.78·db.

## How to study and solve problems
Start with the observations provided—maps, sections, profiles, or time series—and write two or three plain‑language sentences about what you see before explaining why. Translate those observations into mechanisms: packed isopycnals imply strong fronts and vertical shear; cold coastal tongues with favorable winds imply upwelling; closed sea‑level contours imply eddies with rotation set by hemisphere. Use back‑of‑envelope numbers to check scale (e.g., geostrophic speeds from SSH slopes, wave speeds from depth or period), then finish with a concise conclusion and, if appropriate, the next measurement you would take.

## Study roadmap
Build fluency with T–S diagrams and potential density so you can identify water masses and mixing quickly. Practice reading 500‑mb and surface analyses only insofar as they inform winds over the ocean and likely Ekman responses. For coasts, learn to read bathymetry and shoreline geometry to predict wave refraction, focusing, and longshore transport. Finally, connect variability across timescales—diurnal tides, seasonal mixed‑layer cycles, and interannual ENSO signals—to typical biological and sediment responses.
