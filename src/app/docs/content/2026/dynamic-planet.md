## Overview
Dynamic Planet focuses each season on a major Earth system subtopic (e.g., oceans, glaciation, tectonics, or Earth’s fresh waters). Use this overview to orient, then dive into the current‑year sections below.

## Current‑year focus
- Oceanography: seawater properties, circulation, waves, tides, coasts, geological oceanography, climate variability, and tools.

## Sections
- Seawater properties and processes → see: Glaciers (historical topic), Earth’s Fresh Waters (hydrology), and Oceanography (current)
- Surface and deep circulation; Ekman transport; thermohaline → Oceanography
- Waves and tides; coastal processes → Oceanography
- Geological oceanography (seafloor, tectonics, sediments) → Oceanography
- Climate variability (ENSO, PDO) and change → Oceanography

## Quick formulas and relationships (qualitative)
- Geostrophic balance: pressure‑gradient force balanced by Coriolis (flow parallel to isobars)
- Ekman transport: surface wind drives 90° net transport (right of wind in N. Hemisphere)
- Wave basics: c ≈ √(g·λ/2π) in deep water (qualitative recognition only unless constants provided)

## Study roadmap
1) Learn seawater properties and typical profiles (T/S/ρ) and how processes shift them
2) Memorize circulation patterns (gyres, western intensification) and tide types
3) Practice map/data interpretation (SST, salinity, currents) and coastal landforms
4) Review tectonic settings and seafloor features; connect to sediment types
