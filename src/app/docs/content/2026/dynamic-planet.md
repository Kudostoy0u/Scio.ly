# Dynamic Planet (2026)

Divisions: B, C  
Type: Study  
Participants: 2–3  
Approx. Time: 50 minutes  
Allowed Materials: Notes/binder and Class I calculator (confirm rules)

## Overview
Earth systems science with rotating subtopics (e.g., oceans, glaciation, tectonics). Emphasis on processes, mapping, and quantitative reasoning.

## Core Topics (dependent on subtopic)
- Earth materials and cycles (water, carbon)  
- Mapping/Imagery: topo, bathy, profiles, remote sensing basics  
- Quantitative: rates, budgets, cross-sections, scaling  
- Case studies and hazards

## Subtopics for 2026
- Earth’s Fresh Waters — rivers, lakes, groundwater
- Glaciers — formation, mass balance, landforms
- Oceanography — surface/deep circulation, waves, tides, coasts
- Tectonics — plates, boundaries, hazards, rates

## Quantitative relationships and units (verify scope)
- Discharge Q = V × A (m³/s); velocity from floats or rating curves
- Gradient S = Δh / L; relief from topo/bathy
- Residence time τ ≈ Volume / Outflow rate
- Recurrence interval R = (n+1)/m (flood frequency); AEP ≈ 1/R
- Wave celerity: deep C ≈ gT/2π; shallow C ≈ √(g·d)
- Tides: spring vs neap cycles and mixed/diurnal/semidiurnal signatures
- Plate rates: v ≈ distance/age (hotspot tracks, magnetic anomalies)

## Map and data skills
- Topo: contour V’s point upstream; calculate slope from profiles; identify fluvial vs glacial valleys
- Bathy: recognize ridges/trenches, abyssal plains; infer spreading centers from symmetry
- Remote sensing: use band combos/indices to identify water/ice/vegetation/rock (see Remote Sensing)
- Cross-sections: construct and annotate from profiles; infer layers and structures

## Field evidence and interpretation
- Fluvial: meanders, cutbanks/point bars, oxbow lakes, levees, terraces
- Glacial: cirques, horns, arêtes, U-shaped valleys, moraines, drumlins, eskers, erratics, striations
- Coastal: longshore drift indicators, spits, barrier islands, wave-cut platforms, deltas/estuaries
- Tectonic: fault scarps, offset streams, volcanic arcs, back-arc basins, triple junctions

## Strategy
- Summarize formulas and typical calculations per subtopic  
- Practice map/imagery interpretation; draw labeled cross-sections  
- Compile case studies linking processes to landforms and hazards

## Practice prompts
- Compute discharge and gradient from a surveyed cross-section; explain effects on competence and capacity
- Identify and justify glacial landforms on a shaded relief map; infer former ice flow direction
- From sea surface height maps, locate western boundary currents and predict upwelling zones
- Use a magnetic anomaly profile to estimate half- and full-spreading rates; comment on asymmetry
