# Engineering CAD (2026)

Division: C  
Type: CAD/Modeling  
Participants: 1–2  
Allowed Materials: Laptops/mice per host; software per guidance

## Overview
Model parts/assemblies to specification in a provided CAD environment with time constraints.

## Core Topics
- Sketch constraints; extrude/revolve/sweep/loft  
- Assemblies/mates; drawings and dimensions  
- File management and standards

## Deep dives
- Parametric modeling: driving dimensions; design intent; constraint strategies
- Assemblies: proper mates; degrees of freedom; detecting overconstraints/conflicts
- Drawings: views, sections, detail views; GD&T basics (if in scope); dimensioning best practices
- Export and file hygiene: naming conventions; versioning; lightweight vs full files

## Speed and accuracy
- Learn platform shortcuts and mouse gestures; template parts/assemblies/drawings
- Build feature patterns; avoid overcomplex sketches; prefer multiple simple features

## Strategy
- Practice platform shortcuts  
- Recreate timed models and assemblies  
- Prepare drawing templates
