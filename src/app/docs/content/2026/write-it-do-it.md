# Write It Do It (2026)

Division: B  
Type: Inquiry/Communication  
Participants: 2  
Approx. Time: per host  
Allowed Materials: Paper/pencil provided

## Overview
One partner writes instructions to recreate a structure; the other partner builds from the written instructions.

## Core Topics
- Technical writing: referencing, orientation, ordering  
- Spatial reasoning; reproducibility  
- Role discipline and timing

## Strategy
- Develop a shared vocabulary and notation  
- Practice timed rounds with role rotation  
- Emphasize clarity and ambiguity reduction

## Writer’s toolkit
- Global reference frame (e.g., designate a front face and axes X/Y/Z)
- Naming convention for parts and colors; count pieces first
- Describe connections in order: reference part → new part orientation → attachment method → count/positioning
- Avoid ambiguous words (near, a little); use precise distances/counts/orientations

## Builder’s toolkit
- Read entire instruction set first; stage parts logically
- Mark completed steps; request clarifications only as rules allow

## Practice prompts
- Write instructions for a 10–15 piece structure in 5 minutes; trade and build; compare differences and refine vocabulary
