## Overview
Planetary science: bodies, geology, atmospheres, dynamics, and missions.

## Core Topics
- Planets/moons/small bodies, composition and geologic processes  
- Orbital mechanics basics; resonances; tides  
- Missions and instrumentation; notable discoveries

## Skills
- Interpret images and data  
- Use key equations and proportional reasoning

## Deep dives
### Orbital mechanics (conceptual)
- Kepler’s 3rd: P^2 ∝ a^3 (around Sun in AU/yr); energy and angular momentum conservation drive speed changes along ellipses.
- Resonances: mean-motion (e.g., 3:2 Pluto–Neptune) produce stability/islands and gaps (Kirkwood in asteroid belt).
- Tides: synchronous rotation and tidal heating (Io, Europa, Enceladus); Roche limit concept.

### Planetary geology themes
- Volcanism: shield vs stratovolcano analogs on other worlds, cryovolcanism on Titan/Enceladus.
- Tectonics: evidence for/against plate tectonics (Earth vs Venus/Mars); rift and wrinkle ridges.
- Atmospheres: greenhouse strengths (Venus strong CO2; Titan methane cycle); haze formation.

### Missions and instruments
- Imaging, spectrometers (IR/UV/vis), RADAR (Magellan on Venus), LIDAR/altimetry, magnetometers; what each reveals.

## Worked examples
- Kepler estimate: P=8 days around Sun-like star → a≈(P^2)^{1/3} AU with P in years: ( (8/365)^2 )^{1/3} ≈ 0.08 AU (exoplanet context)
- Tidal heating concept: Io’s eccentric orbit due to resonance pumps tidal flexing → heat → volcanism

## Practice prompts
- Explain why Io is volcanically active while the Moon is not.
- Compare greenhouse effects on Venus and Earth; discuss observational signatures.
