# Entomology (2026)

Divisions: B, C  
Type: Study (Taxonomy)  
Participants: 2–3  
Approx. Time: 50 minutes  
Allowed Materials: Field guide/binder per rules; hand lens if permitted

> Community-maintained. Update ID list and images for current season.

## Overview
Identification and biology of insects by order (and families where applicable), including anatomy, life cycles, ecology, and importance.

## Core Topics
- External Anatomy: head, thorax, abdomen; mouthparts; wings; legs; antennae
- Internal/Physiology: respiration (tracheae), circulation, nervous, reproduction
- Development: ametaboly, hemimetaboly, holometaboly
- Orders: diagnostic traits, examples, significance
- Ecology/Behavior: pollination, predation, parasitism, communication
- IPM and human impact; beneficial vs pest species

## High-Yield Skills
- Rapid order-level ID from photos/specimens  
- Distinguish similar orders (e.g., Hemiptera vs Homoptera historic usage)  
- Recognize mouthparts and wing venation patterns

## Diagnostic cheatsheet (order-level)
- Coleoptera: elytra (hardened forewings), chewing mouthparts; holometabolous
- Diptera: one pair of wings + halteres; varied mouthparts (sponging, piercing); holometabolous
- Hymenoptera: two pairs membranous; narrow waist in many; chewing/chewing-lapping; holometabolous
- Lepidoptera: scaled wings; siphoning proboscis; holometabolous
- Hemiptera: piercing-sucking beak; hemelytra in Heteroptera; hemimetabolous
- Orthoptera: enlarged hind legs; chewing; hemimetabolous
- Odonata: two pairs equal wings with net venation; aquatic nymphs with labial mask; hemimetabolous

## Strategy
- Build laminated order/family cards with diagnostics & exemplars  
- Practice timed ID rounds; explain reasoning succinctly  
- Include life stage and metamorphosis clues

## Study Roadmap
1) Memorize order diagnostics with images  
2) Add common families and economic/ecological notes  
3) Drill mixed-photo sets; time constrained  
4) Review life cycles and morphology vocabulary

## Pitfalls
- Over-reliance on size/color  
- Ignoring mouthparts and wing coupling/venation  
- Confusing nymph vs larva characteristics

## Practice Prompts
- Identify order + key trait from image  
- Explain life cycle and role in ecosystem  
- Compare/contrast two similar orders

## Worked IDs
1) Halteres visible; sponging mouthparts → Diptera (house fly family vs blow fly distinguish by bristles/color)
2) Piercing-sucking beak; X-pattern hemelytra → Hemiptera (Heteroptera)
3) Scaled wings; coiled proboscis → Lepidoptera; antennae clubbed (butterfly) vs filamentous/plumose (moths)
