## Overview
Potions and Poisons blends basic chemistry of household/consumer substances with toxicology and safety data interpretation. Master identification tests, reaction patterns, and SDS literacy.

## Identification and reactions
- Acids/bases: pH indicators (litmus, phenolphthalein), reactions with carbonates (CO₂ effervescence), neutralization and heat.
- Solubility: water vs organic; miscibility; density layering; polarity cues.
- Oxidizers/reducers: qualitative recognition (bleach/chlorine oxidizers, hydrogen peroxide); avoid hazardous mixes (bleach + ammonia → chloramines; bleach + acids → chlorine gas).
- Common substances: salts (NaCl, NaHCO₃, CaCO₃), sugars (reducing with Benedict’s conceptually), vinegar (acetic acid), ammonia solution, isopropyl alcohol.

## Toxicology basics
- Dose–response: threshold, LD₅₀ concept (comparative, not for memorization); acute vs chronic effects.
- Routes: ingestion, inhalation, dermal; exposure duration and concentration matter.
- Symptoms: correlate agents to syndromes (solvent inhalation → CNS depression; acids/bases → burns; CO → hypoxia; organophosphates → cholinergic signs).

## SDS literacy
- Sections: identification; hazards; composition; first‑aid; firefighting; accidental release; handling/storage; exposure controls/PPE; physical/chemical properties; stability/reactivity; toxicological information.
- Pictograms: corrosive, oxidizer, flammable, toxic, irritant; signal words (Danger/Warning).
- First aid and response: decontamination, dilution, airway/breathing/circulation; do not induce vomiting unless directed; consult poison control.

## Worked micro‑examples
1) Household mix warning
- Cleaning bathroom with bleach and vinegar → chlorine gas risk: eye/lung irritation, coughing; response: ventilate, leave area, seek medical advice if symptoms.

2) Unknown ID plan
- Test sequence: pH → carbonate test (acid) → solubility/odor → oxidizer test (potassium iodide starch paper concept). Record observations before conclusions.

3) SDS interpretation
- Given an SDS excerpt, identify required PPE, storage temperature, incompatible materials, and first‑aid for skin exposure.

## Pitfalls
- Performing unsafe tests or mixing unknowns; rely on provided reagents and rules.
- Misinterpreting indicator colors; forgetting control tests.
- Confusing concentration (w/w vs w/v) and units in SDS or labels.

## Practice prompts
- Design a safe identification sequence for three clear household liquids (vinegar, isopropyl alcohol, ammonia) using pH, odor (if allowed), and solubility.
- From a mock SDS, extract hazard statements and appropriate spill response.
- Explain how to neutralize small acid vs base spills safely (scope: concept only).
