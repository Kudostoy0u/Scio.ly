## Overview
Chemistry of household substances and toxins: identification, reactions, safety, and SDS literacy.

## Core Topics
- Acids/bases; solutions; reactions; ID tests  
- Toxicology basics; symptom recognition  
- SDS interpretation; safe handling/disposal

## Identification and reactions
- Common household reagents: indicators (pH strips/phenolphthalein), solubility, gas evolution (CO2 from carbonates), precipitation
- Recognize classes: acids vs bases (pH, reactions), oxidizers/reducers (qualitatively), common salts

## Toxicology
- Dose–response concept; routes of exposure; acute vs chronic effects
- Symptom patterns for common agents (e.g., bleach+ammonia → chloramines; never mix cleaners)

## SDS literacy
- Sections: hazards, handling, storage, first aid, disposal; pictograms and signal words

## Safety
- PPE, ventilation, labeling; safe neutralization and cleanup (follow rules and SDS)
