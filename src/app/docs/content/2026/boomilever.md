## Overview
Design and construct a cantilevered structure to support maximum load relative to mass (efficiency).

## Core Topics
- Statics: tension vs compression, load paths  
- Material selection and joint design  
- Build jigs, tolerances, and measurement

## Deep dives
- Load path and failure modes: tension member yielding vs compression member buckling; local buckling and shear at joints
- Euler buckling (qualitative): slenderness ratio matters; increase moment of inertia with efficient cross-sections and bracing
- Joint design: glue surface prep, lap joints vs butt joints; stress concentrations; curing and humidity effects
- Quality control: weigh subcomponents; measure member straightness; inspect for grain defects (wood)

## Testing and logs
- Maintain build logs with dimensions, mass, adhesive type/amount, curing time, load results
- Use simple test rigs before official run to detect weak joints/buckling members

## Strategy
- Optimize stiffness-to-mass where needed; place material where it increases I most (far from neutral axis)
- Standardize cuts and jigs; batch-build and select best units for competition

## Strategy
- Iterate designs; log efficiencies  
- Weigh components; quality control  
- Practice mounting/loading protocol
