# <Cipher Name>

## What it is
- Clear, detailed description of how the cipher transforms letters step-by-step.
- Give a concrete mini-example on 3–5 letters to illustrate the rule.
- State the exact decode rule users will apply by hand.

## Key facts you need
- Minimal facts required to solve (alphabet mapping, valid keys, constraints, tables).
- Keep it practical: what to write down, what to preserve (spaces/punct), and any common shortcuts.

## Step-by-step solving workflow
1) Step 1 in plain language; what to mark or look for.
2) Step 2 with a tiny worked sub-example (numbers/letters shown).
3) Step 3 apply/verify and sanity checks.

## Worked example (full walk-through)
- Provide a short ciphertext.
- Show key choice/derivation explicitly (with numbers/letters) if applicable.
- Decode line-by-line or table-based as appropriate.
- Present final plaintext and explain why it’s consistent.

## Practice
- 2–3 short practice prompts (with keys or clear directions) and the solutions listed immediately below.
