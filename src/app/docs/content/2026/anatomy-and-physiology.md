## In‑depth guide (system by system)

### Skeletal system
The skeleton provides structural support, protection, mineral storage, and hematopoiesis. Long bones expand via endochondral ossification at growth plates, where chondrocytes proliferate, hypertrophy, and are replaced by bone; flat bones form intramembranously from mesenchyme. Compact bone consists of osteons (Haversian systems) with concentric lamellae around central canals; spongy bone has trabeculae aligned to stress. Osteoblasts lay osteoid and mineralize, osteoclasts resorb by acidifying the lacuna; remodeling balances microdamage repair and calcium homeostasis under control of PTH (increases serum Ca²⁺ via osteoclast activation indirectly) and calcitonin (minor role). Vitamin D enhances intestinal Ca²⁺/phosphate absorption; deficiency leads to rickets/osteomalacia, while estrogen deficiency accelerates osteoclast activity → osteoporosis. Fracture healing proceeds through hematoma, soft callus (fibrocartilage), hard callus (woven bone), then remodeling to lamellar bone; impaired by poor perfusion or systemic disease.

Histology cues: osteocytes within lacunae connected by canaliculi; cement lines demarcate old remodeling units. Clinical correlations: hyperparathyroidism (subperiosteal resorption), osteogenesis imperfecta (collagen defect), osteopetrosis (osteoclast dysfunction).

### Muscular system
Skeletal muscle fibers are multinucleated with striations from sarcomeres (Z‑line to Z‑line). The sliding filament model: Ca²⁺ binds troponin C, tropomyosin shifts, myosin heads attach to actin and perform power strokes using ATP. The length–tension relationship peaks near resting length; force–velocity tradeoff lowers shortening velocity at higher loads. Motor unit recruitment follows size principle; summation and tetanus increase force by raising stimulation frequency. Fiber types: type I (oxidative, fatigue‑resistant) vs type II (glycolytic, fast). Cardiac muscle features intercalated discs (gap junctions/desmosomes) and myogenic AP; smooth muscle uses calmodulin–MLCK and often exhibits latch state.

Energy systems (ATP–PCr, glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation) supply graded power; lactate shuttles buffer redox. Clinical: myasthenia gravis (NMJ antibodies), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (dystrophin), malignant hyperthermia (RYR1).

### Integumentary system
Epidermis layers: stratum basale (stem cells/melanocytes), spinosum (desmosomes), granulosum (keratohyalin), lucidum (thick skin), corneum (keratin). Keratinocytes differentiate upward; melanocytes transfer melanin to protect DNA. Dermis (papillary + reticular) houses vasculature, nerves, adnexal structures; hypodermis stores fat. Barrier functions include water loss prevention and immune surveillance (Langerhans cells). Wound healing: hemostasis → inflammation → proliferation (granulation, re‑epithelialization) → remodeling; hypertrophic scars vs keloids reflect collagen regulation.

### Cardiovascular system
The heart’s conduction (SA → AV → His–Purkinje) coordinates systole/diastole. Pressure–volume loops integrate preload (EDV), afterload (arterial pressure), and contractility; Frank–Starling aligns stroke volume with venous return. Arteries (elastance) dampen pulsatility; arterioles regulate resistance; capillaries allow exchange driven by Starling forces (hydrostatic vs oncotic). Veins are capacitance vessels with valves and muscle pumps. Hemostasis involves vasoconstriction, platelet plug (vWF, GP1b/IIb–IIIa), and coagulation cascades (intrinsic/extrinsic → common pathway). Lipoprotein handling (LDL/HDL) underlies atherogenesis via endothelial injury, lipid accumulation, and inflammation.

ECG anchors: PR reflects AV nodal conduction; QRS width ventricular depolarization; QTc prolongation predisposes to torsades. Murmur patterns connect to valve lesions (e.g., holosystolic MR vs late systolic MVP); exam vignettes often test compensation (SNS, RAAS) in heart failure.

### Respiratory system
Ventilation depends on compliance (C = ΔV/ΔP) and airway resistance (Poiseuille). Alveolar ventilation VA = (VT−VD)·RR; dead space (anatomic + alveolar) dilutes gas exchange. Diffusion (Fick’s law) scales with surface area and inverse thickness; DLCO drops with fibrosis/emphysema. V/Q mismatch ranges from shunt (V/Q→0) to dead space (V/Q→∞); hypoxemia corrects variably with O₂. Control of breathing integrates central chemoreceptors (PaCO₂ via pH) and peripheral (PaO₂). Spirometry separates obstructive (↓FEV1/FVC, ↑RV/TLC) from restrictive (↓↓ TLC with near‑normal ratio). ABGs: categorize primary disorders (metabolic/respiratory) and compensations (e.g., Winter’s formula qualitatively).

### Digestive system (GI + HPB)
Oral to esophageal transit uses peristalsis and LES tone; stomach acid/pepsin initiate protein digestion. Pancreatic enzymes (trypsin, lipase, amylase) and bile salts enable small‑intestinal digestion and micelle‑mediated lipid absorption; brush‑border transporters (SGLT1 for glucose/galactose) finish uptake. The liver performs metabolism, detoxification (phase I/II), bile production, and synthesizes albumin/clotting factors; portal circulation creates shunt pathology. Portal hypertension leads to varices/ascites via splanchnic vasodilation and hypoalbuminemia. Malabsorption clues: steatorrhea (lipid), anemia from B12/iron deficiency (site‑specific). Lab patterns: cholestatic (↑ALP/γ‑GT, bilirubin) vs hepatocellular (↑AST/ALT).

### Nervous system
Neurons encode information via action potentials and synaptic integration; EPSPs/IPSPs sum temporally/spatially. Neurotransmitters (glutamate, GABA, ACh, monoamines) activate ionotropic/metabotropic receptors; plasticity includes LTP/LTD. PNS divisions (somatic/autonomic) mediate reflex arcs; CNS regions (cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, brainstem) coordinate movement, cognition, and homeostasis. Localize lesions using motor (UMN spastic vs LMN flaccid), sensory modalities, and cranial nerve findings. Blood–brain barrier and CSF dynamics frame pathology.

### Endocrine system
Peptide vs steroid/thyroid hormones differ by solubility and receptor location (membrane vs nuclear). Axis paradigms (HPA, HPT, HPG) use feedback loops; binding proteins and receptor sensitivity modulate effects. Thyroid disorders display reciprocal TSH/T4 changes; adrenal pathology separates primary (Addison’s, high ACTH) from secondary (pituitary). Diabetes: insulin deficiency/resistance → hyperglycemia, osmotic diuresis; interpret A1c and fasting glucose qualitatively.

### Immune/Lymphatic system
Innate immunity provides rapid pattern recognition (TLRs, complement) and antigen presentation; adaptive immunity relies on clonal expansion and memory (B‑cell antibodies, T‑cell cytotoxic/help). Hypersensitivity types I–IV provide clinical patterns (anaphylaxis, cytotoxic, immune complex, delayed); vaccination leverages primary/secondary responses and herd effects. Lymphatics clear interstitial fluid and traffic lymphocytes; node architecture (cortex follicles, paracortex T‑cells, medulla) supports activation.

### Renal/Urinary system
Filtration at the glomerulus produces ultrafiltrate; autoregulation (myogenic, tubuloglomerular feedback) stabilizes GFR. Proximal tubule reclaims bulk solute; loop of Henle establishes medullary osmotic gradient; distal/collecting segments fine‑tune Na⁺/K⁺/water via aldosterone/ADH. Acid–base balance includes bicarbonate reclamation and ammoniagenesis. RAAS maintains perfusion via Ang II (efferent constriction) and aldosterone; ANP opposes volume loading. Urinalysis findings integrate specific gravity, protein, glucose, and casts (RBC vs WBC vs granular) to localize disease.

### Reproductive system
HPG axis controls gametogenesis and steroidogenesis. Ovarian cycle (follicular → ovulation → luteal) produces cyclic estrogen/progesterone changes that prepare endometrium; menstrual cycle pathologies often test timing and feedback (e.g., anovulation). Testicular Leydig (testosterone) and Sertoli (support, inhibin) functions regulate spermatogenesis. Pregnancy physiology alters blood volume, GFR, and endocrine milieu (hCG, placental steroids).

### Special senses
Vision: phototransduction in rods/cones hyperpolarizes in response to light (cGMP‑gated channels); retinal circuitry processes signals to ganglion cells and the optic nerve; visual fields map to calcarine cortex. Hearing: cochlear hair cells transduce basilar membrane motion; vestibular system senses rotation/linear acceleration via semicircular canals and otolith organs. Taste/smell employ GPCR/ion channel mechanisms.

### Clinical integration and labs
CBC: anemia patterns (microcytic iron deficiency vs macrocytic B12), leukocytosis differentials. BMP: electrolytes reflect endocrine/renal states (hyperkalemia in hypoaldosteronism). ABG: link respiratory/renal compensation. Urinalysis: proteinuria/hematuria patterns. EKG: rhythm and ischemia basics. Imaging: X‑ray density patterns (bone/lung), ultrasound for abdomen; CT/MRI indications.
