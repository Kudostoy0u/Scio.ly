## Overview
Anatomy & Physiology is about turning structure–function relationships into fast, testable explanations. Study efficiently by building mental maps for each system—what the parts are, how they work together, and how typical pathologies break those links—and by practicing cross‑system integration. Histology and imaging anchor recognition; simple calculations (MAP, ventilations) and lab values (CBC, ABGs, hormones) anchor interpretation.

## 2026 focus and structure
Expect station‑style questions that mix labeling, short mechanisms, and case vignettes across multiple systems. The most time‑saving approach is to prepare one‑page summaries per system that combine gross anatomy landmarks, core physiology pathways, and two or three hallmark disorders or lab patterns. During practice, rotate systems so you regularly integrate endocrine feedback with cardiovascular or renal control and connect respiratory mechanics to ABGs and ventilations.

## Core systems and topics
- Skeletal: bones, landmarks, ossification, remodeling, fractures
- Muscular: muscle types, sarcomere, excitation–contraction coupling, energetics
- Integumentary: layers, appendages, thermoregulation, wound healing
- Cardiovascular: anatomy, cardiac cycle, ECG basics, blood components, hemodynamics
- Respiratory: anatomy, gas exchange, mechanics, volumes/capacities, control
- Digestive: organs, enzymes, absorption, liver/pancreas, microbiome
- Nervous: central/peripheral, neurons/glia, synaptic transmission, reflexes
- Endocrine: major glands/hormones, axes, feedback loops, receptors
- Immune/Lymphatic: innate/adaptive, antibodies, vaccination, hypersensitivities
- Urinary: nephron, filtration/reabsorption/secretion, RAAS, acid–base
- Reproductive: gametogenesis, hormones, menstrual cycle, pregnancy basics
- Special Senses: eye/ear, transduction, common disorders

## High‑yield skills
- Identify histology slides and gross anatomy landmarks
- Interpret clinical vignettes and lab values (CBC, ABGs, hormones)
- Trace physiological pathways and feedback loops

## System deep dives (essentials)
### Cardiovascular
- Cardiac cycle: S1 (AV close), S2 (semilunar close); pressure–volume loop phases (isovolumic contract/relax); preload/afterload/contractility effects
- ECG basics: P (atrial depol), QRS (ventricular depol), T (ventricular repol); intervals: PR (~120–200 ms), QRS (<120 ms), QTc; axis clues
- Hemodynamics: Poiseuille (qualitative), MAP ≈ (SBP + 2·DBP)/3; Starling curve; anemia vs dehydration effects on flow

### Respiratory
- Mechanics: compliance vs resistance; obstructive (↑RV, ↓FEV1/FVC) vs restrictive (↓volumes, normal/high FEV1/FVC)
- Gas exchange: V/Q matching; A–a gradient concept; hypoxemia causes (low FiO2, hypovent, diffusion, V/Q mismatch, shunt)
- ABG patterns (qualitative): metabolic vs respiratory acidosis/alkalosis; simple compensation rules

### Endocrine
- Axes: HPA (CRH→ACTH→cortisol), HPT (TRH→TSH→T3/T4), HPG (GnRH→LH/FSH→sex steroids) with negative feedback
- Hormone classes: peptide (membrane receptors, rapid), steroid/thyroid (nuclear receptors, genomic)
- Disorders: primary vs secondary insufficiency/hyperfunction; lab patterns (e.g., high TSH + low T4 → primary hypothyroid)

### Renal
- Nephron: filtration at glomerulus; reabsorption (PCT bulk, loop countercurrent, DCT/collecting fine‑tuning)
- RAAS: renin→Ang II (efferent constriction, aldosterone release); ADH water reabsorption; acid–base handling (bicarbonate reclamation)
- Interpreting urine findings (qualitative): specific gravity, protein, glucose, casts

### Nervous
- Neuron physiology: resting potential, AP propagation, synaptic transmission (ionotropic vs metabotropic)
- Autonomic: sympathetic vs parasympathetic effects by organ
- Localization: UMN vs LMN signs; basic cranial nerve functions

### Hematology/Immune detail
- Hematopoiesis basics; CBC interpretation (RBC indices MCV/MCHC; WBC differential patterns)
- Innate PRRs (TLRs conceptually), complement pathways (classical/alternate/lectin)
- Adaptive: clonal selection, MHC I/II presentations; antibody classes (IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE)

### GI/Hepato–Pancreato–Biliary
- Enzymes and absorption sites; bile roles; pancreatic enzyme activation; microbiome roles
- Common lab patterns: cholestatic vs hepatocellular injury; malabsorption clues

### Musculoskeletal
- Sarcomere structure; length–tension; motor unit recruitment; fiber types
- Bone remodeling: osteoclast/osteoblast coupling; PTH/vitamin D; osteoporosis risk factors (qualitative)

### Endocrine clinical patterns
- Hyper/hypo‑thyroid lab triads; adrenal insufficiency vs Cushingoid features; diabetes basics

### Immune/Lymphatic system
- Innate vs adaptive roles; hypersensitivity types I–IV; vaccination principles
- Lymphatic drainage logic and node microanatomy (survey)

### Renal/Urinary system details
- Autoregulation (myogenic, tubuloglomerular); medullary gradient and urea recycling (qualitative)

### Special senses
- Vision (phototransduction basics); hearing (hair‑cell transduction); vestibular function

## Practice prompts
- Label histology and predict functional consequences of lesions
- Interpret ECG or ABG in clinical context
- Predict downstream hormone changes for a given axis defect
