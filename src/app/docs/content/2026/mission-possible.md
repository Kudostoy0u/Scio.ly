# Mission Possible (2026)

Division: B  
Type: Build (Rube Goldberg)  
Participants: 2  
Allowed Materials: Device components per rules; logs; eye protection; impound

## Overview
Device performs prescribed tasks via energy transfers and mechanisms with reliability and compliance.

## Core Topics
- Task mapping to reliable mechanisms  
- Energy transfers; timing and sequencing  
- Documentation and checklists

## Design framework
- Map each required task to a proven mechanism; avoid high-variance devices (e.g., random rolling) unless necessary
- Sequence with deterministic triggers (gravity, magnets, electrical if allowed) and avoid resets mid-chain
- Build for serviceability: modules that can be swapped; labeled wiring/links; standard fasteners

## Scoring and reliability
- Identify high-point tasks; allocate extra reliability margin there
- Measure success rates in testing; improve weakest links iteratively
- Keep cycle times within limits; manage idle times and delays

## Documentation and compliance
- Maintain a parts/changes log; include measurements and safety
- Pre-competition checklist: dimensions, power, safety shields, fasteners, fast fail tests

## Strategy
- Minimize randomness; test cycles  
- Track success rates and cycle times  
- Compliance verification before competition
