# Teams Feature Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for all teams features, including business logic flows, API routes, and database schemas.

## Structure

- `API_ROUTES.md` - Complete documentation of all teams API routes with business logic flows
- `BUSINESS_LOGIC.md` - Core business logic and workflows
- `SCHEMA.md` - Database schema reference for teams tables
- `TESTING.md` - Testing guide for teams features
- `FLOWCHARTS.md` - Visual flow charts for major team workflows

## Purpose

This documentation serves as the single source of truth for:
- Understanding how teams features work
- Implementing new features
- Debugging issues
- Onboarding new developers

All routes and business logic flows are documented here to ensure code robustness and prevent hallucinations about database operations and field support.
