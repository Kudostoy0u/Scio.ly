-- Tables already exist in the database
-- This migration is a no-op since bookmarks, game_points, and user_stats tables
-- are already present in the database with the correct schema
-- 
-- The existing tables have the following structure:
-- - bookmarks: id, user_id, question_data, event_name, source, created_at
-- - game_points: id, user_id, points, source, description, created_at  
-- - user_stats: id, user_id, date, questions_attempted, correct_answers, events_practiced, event_questions, game_points, created_at
--
-- No changes needed - schema is already correct
