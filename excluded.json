In his method, the light ray hits a small rotating mirror, travels a distance h away, reflects back on the mirror and hits it again. The mirror has rotated a small amount while the light was traveling. The angle it has rotated is known as the angular velocity (\u03c9).   a) Determine the time it takes for the light ray to reflect off the rotating mirror and form the image. b) Determine the angular velocity of the light using your answer from part (a) and then find the angle the mirror rotates during this time if the velocity of light is 30 x 10^8 m/s and h= 28000 km, and the mirror is rotating at 28000 rad/s.",

      "question": "The absorbance of a solution at a wavelength is the sum of the absorbances of all compounds in that solution. If we take data at multiple wavelengths, and know the absorption spectra of the individual compounds in solution, we can figure out the concentration of each compound. Instead of our normal linear regressions where we are trying to solve for one variable, we need to solve for as many variables as there are solutions. An unknown mixture of two compounds, J and K, was measured in a spectrophotometer at multiple wavelengths, along with known standards of the individual compounds. Our standard of J had a concentration of 0.001540 M, and our standard of K had a concentration of 0.003920 M. The results are shown in the table below. The least squares solution to a multiple linear regression for the equation y = m1x1 + m2x2 + b can be found using the following formula. m1 = [(\u03a3x2 2)\u2013(\u03a3x1x2)2], and vice versa for m2. From the data we have, plot and label the absorption spectra of all three solutions on a single graph in the space on the answer sheet. Please be neat.",
